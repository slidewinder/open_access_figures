abstract: 'The origin and extreme diversification of the animal nervous system is a central question in biology. While most of the attention has traditionally been paid to those lineages with highly elaborated nervous systems (e.g. arthropods, vertebrates, annelids), only the study of the vast animal diversity can deliver a comprehensive view of the evolutionary history of this organ system. In this regard, the phylogenetic position and apparently conservative molecular, morphological and embryological features of priapulid worms (Priapulida) place this animal lineage as a key to understanding the evolution of the Ecdysozoa (i.e. arthropods and nematodes). In this study, we characterize the nervous system of the hatching larva and first lorica larva of the priapulid worm Priapulus caudatus by immunolabelling against acetylated and tyrosinated tubulin, pCaMKII, serotonin and FMRFamide. Our results show that a circumoral brain and an unpaired ventral nerve with a caudal ganglion characterize the central nervous system of hatching embryos. After the first moult, the larva attains some adult features: a neck ganglion, an introvert plexus, and conspicuous secondary longitudinal neurites. Our study delivers a neuroanatomical framework for future embryological studies in priapulid worms, and helps illuminate the course of nervous system evolution in the Ecdysozoa.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Localization of pCaMKII and tyrosinated tubulin in *P. caudatus* larvae. (*a–f*) Maximal *z*-projections of confocal stacks of whole mount larvae stained against pCaMKII (in grey) or tyrosinated tubulin (TyrTub, in grey) and counterstained with the nuclear marker Sytox Green (red, in *a*, *c* and *e*). (*a*) In the hatching larva of *P. caudatus*, antisera against phosphorylated CaMKII localize in the circumoral brain nerves (yellow arrows) and ventral nerve (green arrowheads). (*b*) The ventral nerve (green arrowheads) connects to the brain (yellow arrow) anteriorly, folding inside the body as the introvert retracts. (*c,d*) In the first lorica larva, immunoreactivity to pCaMKII is stronger in the brain (yellow arrows), the neck ganglion (blue arrowheads), ventral nerve (green arrowheads), and nerve projections towards the buccal scalids (white arrowheads in *d*). (*e,f*) Immunoreactivity against TyrTub appears in the first lorica larva, greatly concentrated in the circumoral brain (yellow arrows), neck ganglion (blue arrowheads), main ventral nerve (green arrowheads) and the innervation of the scalids (white arrowheads in *f*). In all cases, the asterisk indicates the position of the mouth. The staining in the eggshell and the lorica in (*a*) and (*c*) is background. All panels are ventral–lateral views. eg, eggshell; lc, lorica; sc, scalids. Scale bars, 25 µm in all panels.</p>
