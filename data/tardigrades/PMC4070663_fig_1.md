abstract: 'A PCR-DGGE primer pair, Tyl2F-Tyl4R, specific to plant parasitic and fungivorous nematodes was designed based on the 18S rRNA gene. The results of community analysis using the primers showed that they are specific to the order Tylenchida. This primer pair detected species belonging to Tylenchida with high sensitivity and high resolution. The number of detected species of plant parasitic and fungivorous nematodes and their band intensity were much improved compared with PCR-DGGE analysis using the SSU18A-SSU9R primer, which is commonly used for nematode community analysis. It was confirmed that using a group-specific primer was effective for nematode community analysis with PCR-DGGE.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>DGGE profiles of the four nematode communities obtained using two primer pairs. DGGE profiles obtained with the primer pair SSU18A-SSU9R are shown in the left lane and profiles obtained with Tyl2F-Tyl4R are shown in the right lane for each nematode community. Numbers indicate the DGGE bands for sequence analysis and homology searches. These numbers are also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-28_269">Table 2</xref>. Bands marked ‘ns’ could not be sequenced.</p>
