abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Determination and quantification of nucleic acid components in a mixture is usually accomplished by microarray approaches, where the mixtures are hybridized against specific probes. As an alternative, we propose here that a single sequencing reaction from a mixture of nucleic acids holds enough information to potentially distinguish the different components, provided it is known which components can occur in the mixture. RESULTS: We describe an algorithm that is based on a set of linear equations which can be solved when the sequencing profiles of the individual components are known and when the number of sequenced nucleotides is larger than the number of components in the mixture. We have implemented the procedure for one type of sequencing approach, pyrosequencing, which produces a stepwise output of peaks that is particularly suitable for the procedure. As an example we use signature sequences from ribosomal RNA to distinguish and quantify several different species in a mixture. Using simulations, we show that the procedure may also be applicable for dideoxy sequencing on capillary sequencers, requiring only some instrument specific adaptations of protocols and software. CONCLUSION: The parallel sequencing approach described here may become a simple and cheap alternative to microarray experiments which aim at routine re-determination and quantification of known nucleic acid components from environmental samples or tissue samples.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Sequence alignments for the seven taxa used in this study covering the region that is probed by the pyrosequencing procedure with 60 dispensation steps (dispensation order: A-T-G-C). The underlined part represents the primer that was used for the sequencing reaction. The length of the sequence recorded by the pyrosequencing procedure depends on the exact order of the nucleotides and the order of the dispensation steps. Hence, it is slightly different for the different sequences.</p>
