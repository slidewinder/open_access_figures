abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Onychophora are a probable sister group to Arthropoda, one of the most intensively studied animal phyla from a developmental perspective. Pioneering work on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and subsequent investigation of other arthropods has revealed important roles for Wnt genes during many developmental processes in these animals. RESULTS: We screened the embryonic transcriptome of the onychophoran Euperipatoides kanangrensis and found that at least 11 Wnt genes are expressed during embryogenesis. These genes represent 11 of the 13 known subfamilies of Wnt genes. CONCLUSIONS: Many onychophoran Wnt genes are expressed in segment polarity gene-like patterns, suggesting a general role for these ligands during segment regionalization, as has been described in arthropods. During early stages of development, Wnt2, Wnt4, and Wnt5 are expressed in broad multiple segment-wide domains that are reminiscent of arthropod gap and Hox gene expression patterns, which suggests an early instructive role for Wnt genes during E. kanangrensis segmentation.'

### Figure 7
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Expression of *****E. kanangrensis Wnt6 *****and *****Wnt7. *****(A-D)** Expression of *Wnt6*; **(E-I)** Expression of *Wnt7*. In **(A-G)**, anterior is to the left; in **(H)** and **(I)**, anterior is up. **(A)** Dorsal view. Arrow indicates expression in the tip of the developing frontal appendage. **(B)** Lateral view. Arrows indicate expression in the ventral nervous system. **(C)** Ventral view. Close-up of the jaw- and slime papillae-bearing segments. Arrow indicates staining in the salivary gland. Asterisk marks transverse ventral stripe. Note that it is level with the salivary gland. **(D)** Ventral view. Close-up of the anterior part of an embryo. **(E)** Lateral view. **(F)** Ventrolateral view. Arrowhead indicates expression between the limbs. Arrow indicates the same expression in a younger (more posterior) segment. Note the transformation of this expression domain from younger towards older segments. **(G)** Close-up of segmentally reiterated mesodermal expression in the trunk. **(H)** Ventral view. Asterisk marks expression in the ventral nervous system. **(I)** Ventral view. Asterisk marks expression in the ventral nervous system. **(C′)** represents DAPI staining of the embryo of **(C)**. fap, frontal appendage; hl, head lobe; j, jaw; L1 to L3, first to third walking-limb-bearing segments; sp, slime papilla; st, stage.</p>
