abstract: 'The origin and extreme diversification of the animal nervous system is a central question in biology. While most of the attention has traditionally been paid to those lineages with highly elaborated nervous systems (e.g. arthropods, vertebrates, annelids), only the study of the vast animal diversity can deliver a comprehensive view of the evolutionary history of this organ system. In this regard, the phylogenetic position and apparently conservative molecular, morphological and embryological features of priapulid worms (Priapulida) place this animal lineage as a key to understanding the evolution of the Ecdysozoa (i.e. arthropods and nematodes). In this study, we characterize the nervous system of the hatching larva and first lorica larva of the priapulid worm Priapulus caudatus by immunolabelling against acetylated and tyrosinated tubulin, pCaMKII, serotonin and FMRFamide. Our results show that a circumoral brain and an unpaired ventral nerve with a caudal ganglion characterize the central nervous system of hatching embryos. After the first moult, the larva attains some adult features: a neck ganglion, an introvert plexus, and conspicuous secondary longitudinal neurites. Our study delivers a neuroanatomical framework for future embryological studies in priapulid worms, and helps illuminate the course of nervous system evolution in the Ecdysozoa.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Localization of FLPs in *P. caudatus* larvae. (*a–f*) Maximal *z*-projections of confocal stacks of whole mount larvae stained with an anti-FMRFamide antibody (*a–d*, in grey; *d* and *e*, in red) or against tyrosinated tubulin (TyrTub; *e* and *f*, in grey) and counterstained with the nuclear marker Sytox Green (red, in *a*, *c* and *d*). (*a*) In the hatching larva, FLPs are detected in a bipolar cell (white arrowheads in magnification in (*b*) at the caudal ganglion (brown arrowhead). (*c*) After the first moult, FLP immunoreactivity is observed in the neuropil (yellow arrows), caudal ganglion (brown arrowhead) and several cells of the trunk (white arrowheads). (*d*) The epithelial cells lining the lumen of the buccal cavity exhibit immunoreactivity for FLPs (white arrowhead). (*e*) Magnification of the squared region in (*c*). FLP immunoreactivity in the introvert is observed in the brain neuropil (yellow arrows; neck ganglion indicated by blue arrowheads). (*f*) In the posterior region, FLPs are observed in two cells of the caudal ganglion (brown arroheads) at the end of the main ventral nerve (green arrowheads) and in cells of the thin neurite bundles departing from the trunk tubuli (white arrowheads). In all cases, the asterisk indicates the position of the mouth. All panels are ventral–lateral views. lc, lorica; lt, lorica tubulus; sc, scalids. Scale bars, 25 µm in (*a,c,e,f*); 10 µm in (*b,d*).</p>
