abstract: 'Upon desiccation, some tardigrades enter an ametabolic dehydrated state called anhydrobiosis and can survive a desiccated environment in this state. For successful transition to anhydrobiosis, some anhydrobiotic tardigrades require pre-incubation under high humidity conditions, a process called preconditioning, prior to exposure to severe desiccation. Although tardigrades are thought to prepare for transition to anhydrobiosis during preconditioning, the molecular mechanisms governing such processes remain unknown. In this study, we used chemical genetic approaches to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of anhydrobiosis in the anhydrobiotic tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini. We first demonstrated that inhibition of transcription or translation drastically impaired anhydrobiotic survival, suggesting that de novo gene expression is required for successful transition to anhydrobiosis in this tardigrade. We then screened 81 chemicals and identified 5 chemicals that significantly impaired anhydrobiotic survival after severe desiccation, in contrast to little or no effect on survival after high humidity exposure only. In particular, cantharidic acid, a selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and PP2A, exhibited the most profound inhibitory effects. Another PP1/PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, also significantly and specifically impaired anhydrobiotic survival, suggesting that PP1/PP2A activity plays an important role for anhydrobiosis in this species. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the required activities of signaling molecules for desiccation tolerance in tardigrades. The identified inhibitory chemicals could provide novel clues to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Effects of inhibition of transcription and translation on anhydrobiotic survival.</title> (A) Scheme of chemical treatment and subsequent desiccation tolerance assay. Tardigrades were incubated in a chemical solution or 1% DMSO solution (control) for 5 h. After chemical treatment and 1 day preconditioning at 95% RH, one group was exposed to low relative humidity (10% RH) for 2 days (Low humidity exposure). The other group was exposed to high relative humidity (95% RH) for same period (High humidity exposure). (B, C) Effects of a transcription inhibitor (10 μM α-amanitin) on recovery rates at 1 h (B) and 24 h (C) after rehydration. Mean ± SD (N = 4; 20 tardigrades each). (D, E) Effects of translation inhibitor (250 μM cycloheximide) on recovery rates at 1 h (D) and 24 h (E) after rehydration. Mean ± SD (N = 3; 10 tardigrades each). Statistically significant differences among samples were determined by the Tukey-Kramer test (*, *P*&lt;0.05; **, *P*&lt;0.01). Low humidity, low humidity exposure; High humidity, high humidity exposure.</p>
