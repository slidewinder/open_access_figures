abstract: 'Lake Vostok is the largest of the nearly 400 subglacial Antarctic lakes and has been continuously buried by glacial ice for 15 million years. Extreme cold, heat (from possible hydrothermal activity), pressure (from the overriding glacier) and dissolved oxygen (delivered by melting meteoric ice), in addition to limited nutrients and complete darkness, combine to produce one of the most extreme environments on Earth. Metagenomic/metatranscriptomic analyses of ice that accreted over a shallow embayment and over the southern main lake basin indicate the presence of thousands of species of organisms (94% Bacteria, 6% Eukarya, and two Archaea). The predominant bacterial sequences were closest to those from species of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while the predominant eukaryotic sequences were most similar to those from species of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous Fungi. Based on the sequence data, the lake appears to contain a mixture of autotrophs and heterotrophs capable of performing nitrogen fixation, nitrogen cycling, carbon fixation and nutrient recycling. Sequences closest to those of psychrophiles and thermophiles indicate a cold lake with possible hydrothermal activity. Sequences most similar to those from marine and aquatic species suggest the presence of marine and freshwater regions.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Ecological characterization of organisms based on BLAST search results from the V5 and V6 metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequences. The taxonomic classifications listed are based on the highest identities to sequences from species within the taxa that have been documented to have the functions specified in the boxes. These have been grouped primarily by Phylum for simplicity. Greater than 95% of the taxa are either primary producers (autotrophs), bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle, or decomposers, including bacteria and fungi, and a few chromalveolates (shaded green box). Primary and secondary consumers comprise less than 5% of the species richness (*i.e.*, number of unique sequences). Organisms listed in black font were determined by sequences that exhibited ≥97% sequence identity with sequences in GenBank (NCBI). Organisms listed in red font exhibited &lt;97% sequence identity or were suggested because the sequences were closest to symbionts, parasites or pathogens of those organisms (at ≥97% sequence identity).</p>
