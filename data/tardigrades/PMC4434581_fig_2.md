abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The digestive systems of animals can become highly specialized in response to their exploration and occupation of new ecological niches. Although studies on different animals have revealed commonalities in gut formation, the model systems Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, which belong to the invertebrate group Ecdysozoa, exhibit remarkable deviations in how their intestines develop. Their morphological and developmental idiosyncrasies have hindered reconstructions of ancestral gut characters for the Ecdysozoa, and limit comparisons with vertebrate models. In this respect, the phylogenetic position, and slow evolving morphological and molecular characters of marine priapulid worms advance them as a key group to decipher evolutionary events that occurred in the lineages leading to C. elegans and D. melanogaster. RESULTS: In the priapulid Priapulus caudatus, the gut consists of an ectodermal foregut and anus, and a mid region of at least partial endodermal origin. The inner gut develops into a 16-cell primordium devoid of visceral musculature, arranged in three mid tetrads and two posterior duplets. The mouth invaginates ventrally and shifts to a terminal anterior position as the ventral anterior ectoderm differentially proliferates. Contraction of the musculature occurs as the head region retracts into the trunk and resolves the definitive larval body plan. Despite obvious developmental differences with C. elegans and D. melanogaster, the expression in P. caudatus of the gut-related candidate genes NK2.1, foxQ2, FGF8/17/18, GATA456, HNF4, wnt1, and evx demonstrate three distinct evolutionarily conserved molecular profiles that correlate with morphologically identified sub-regions of the gut. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative analysis of priapulid development suggests that a midgut formed by a single endodermal population of vegetal cells, a ventral mouth, and the blastoporal origin of the anus are ancestral features in the Ecdysozoa. Our molecular data on P. caudatus reveal a conserved ecdysozoan gut-patterning program and demonstrates that extreme morphological divergence has not been accompanied by major molecular innovations in transcriptional regulators during digestive system evolution in the Ecdysozoa. Our data help us understand the origins of the ecdysozoan body plan, including those of C. elegans and D. melanogaster, and this is critical for comparisons between these two prominent model systems and their vertebrate counterparts.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Gut formation during *P. caudatus* embryogenesis. z projections of confocal stacks of embryos at 5, 6, 7, and 8&nbsp;days post-fertilization, hatching larva, and the first lorica larva, stained with phallacidin (green) and propidium iodide (magenta). **(A)** Post-gastrula embryos exhibit a parenchymatous endomesoderm (em), a ventrally forming mouth (mo), and a narrowed blastopore (bp) that will give rise to the anus. **(B)** With the onset of organogenesis, the mouth moves to an anterior terminal position, and a digestive tract (dg) connecting the mouth and the anus (an) is visible as a strongly actin-positive bundle. Muscle (mc) differentiation also starts at this stage. **(C,****D)** After organogenesis, the introvert retracts into the trunk, pulling down the digestive tract and mouth to the posterior end of the trunk. The scalids (sc), which develop at the introvert-trunk boundary **(B, B’)**, are located at the anterior end of the introvert as it retracts. **(E)** The hatching larva exhibits a fully developed digestive system, despite the lack of a mouth and anal opening in the cuticle. **(F)** With the first molting, the first lorica larva exhibit greater body complexity, and the digestive system increases its number of cells generally. **(A’-F’)** Schematic drawings of the studied embryonic and larval stages, placed in the general context of priapulid embryonic development. The pairs of arrowheads indicate the position of the introvert-trunk boundary. Drawings are not to scale. All panels and drawings are oriented with the animal/anterior pole to the top. In **A**, ventral side to the left. Scale bars in **A-D** 50&nbsp;μm; and **E** and **F**, 100&nbsp;μm.</p>
