abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Systematic comparisons between genomic sequence datasets have revealed a wide spectrum of sequence specificity from sequences that are highly conserved to those that are specific to individual species. Due to the limited number of fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes, analyses of this spectrum have largely focused on prokaryotes. Combining existing genomic datasets with the partial genomes of 193 eukaryotes derived from collections of expressed sequence tags, we performed a quantitative analysis of the sequence specificity spectrum to provide a global view of the origins and extent of sequence diversity across the three domains of life. RESULTS: Comparisons with prokaryotic datasets reveal a greater genetic diversity within eukaryotes that may be related to differences in modes of genetic inheritance. Mapping this diversity within a phylogenetic framework revealed that the majority of sequences are either highly conserved or specific to the species or taxon from which they derive. Between these two extremes, several evolutionary landmarks consisting of large numbers of sequences conserved within specific taxonomic groups were identified. For example, 8% of sequences derived from metazoan species are specific and conserved within the metazoan lineage. Many of these sequences likely mediate metazoan specific functions, such as cell-cell communication and differentiation. CONCLUSION: Through the use of partial genome datasets, this study provides a unique perspective of sequence conservation across the three domains of life. The provision of taxon restricted sequences should prove valuable for future computational and biochemical analyses aimed at understanding evolutionary and functional relationships.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Phylogenetic profile of 74 gene families derived from 'promiscuous' sequences. We identified 13,055 sequences from the complete genome datasets as possessing significant sequence similarity to each of the 198 complete genomes. Gene family assignments obtained from the COGENT database were used to group these promiscuous sequences into 74 gene families. Annotations associated with the gene families show the high incidence of tRNA synthetases (blue text) and ABC transporters (red text). Phylogenetic profiles of each gene family were constructed from the presence or absence of promiscuous sequences in each genome. Two dimensional hierarchical clustering was performed on the profiles using average linkage on the basis of their Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Colored boxes indicate: presence of a promiscuous sequence in the genome (yellow); presence of a non-promiscuous sequence in the genome (blue, shaded according to the number of genomes with which it shares a sequence similarity match - in cases of more than one family member in a genome, the member with the highest number of matches was used); or absence of any family member in the genome (black box). Although the first nine gene families (indicated by the orange bar) contain representatives from the majority of genomes, the remaining gene families demonstrate various levels of specificity. For example, an additional 17 families (light green bars) are common to at least 50% of the eukaryotic genomes while 25 families possessed promiscuous sequences from only a single genome (purple bar). This specificity has led to a clear grouping of genomes into the three domains of life (as indicated on the left of the figure) with the exceptions of *Cryptosporidium parvum *(placed by itself outside the main group of eukaryotes) and *Plasmodium falciparum*, which has been grouped with two strains of *Tropheryma whipplei *and *Leifsonia xyli*. Both species are members of the Apicomplexa, a group of related protist parasites and appear to lack representative sequences from several of the 17 gene families that help define the other eukaryotes as a single group.</p>
