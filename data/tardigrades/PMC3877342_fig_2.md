abstract: 'Life unfolds within a framework of constraining abiotic factors, yet some organisms are adapted to handle large fluctuations in physical and chemical parameters. Tardigrades are microscopic ecdysozoans well known for their ability to endure hostile conditions, such as complete desiccation--a phenomenon called anhydrobiosis. During dehydration, anhydrobiotic animals undergo a series of anatomical changes. Whether this reorganization is an essential regulated event mediated by active controlled processes, or merely a passive result of the dehydration process, has not been clearly determined. Here, we investigate parameters pivotal to the formation of the so-called "tun", a state that in tardigrades and rotifers marks the entrance into anhydrobiosis. Estimation of body volume in the eutardigrade Richtersius coronifer reveals an 87 % reduction in volume from the hydrated active state to the dehydrated tun state, underlining the structural stress associated with entering anhydrobiosis. Survival experiments with pharmacological inhibitors of mitochondrial energy production and muscle contractions show that i) mitochondrial energy production is a prerequisite for surviving desiccation, ii) uncoupling the mitochondria abolishes tun formation, and iii) inhibiting the musculature impairs the ability to form viable tuns. We moreover provide a comparative analysis of the structural changes involved in tun formation, using a combination of cytochemistry, confocal laser scanning microscopy and 3D reconstructions as well as scanning electron microscopy. Our data reveal that the musculature mediates a structural reorganization vital for anhydrobiotic survival, and furthermore that maintaining structural integrity is essential for resumption of life following rehydration.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Effect of DNP and phalloidin on anhydrobiotic survival.</title> **A**. Pre-incubation in DNP prior to dehydration, and attempting to induce anhydrobiosis (D→A→W), significantly reduces survival to 4 ± 9 % (0.1 mM) and 2 ± 4 % (1.0 mM). **B**. Incubating tardigrades in phalloidin (P→W) did not decrease survival at 0.01 mg/ml (97 ± 7 %), 0.1 mg/ml (96 ± 4 %) and 0.5 (95 ± 5 %) mg/ml. At 1 mg/ml, survival was significantly reduced to 26 ± 7 % (*P*&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085091.s003">Table S2</xref>). Pre-incubation in phalloidin (P→A→W) reduced post-anhydrobiotic survival at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml (82 ± 6 %), 0.5 mg/ml (77 ± 6 %) and 1.0 mg/ml (0 ± 0%) (*P*&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085091.s003">Table S2</xref>). Significant differences between treatments are indicated by asterisks, with the significance levels *P*&gt;0.05 (not significant) and *P*≤0.001 (significant, ***).</p>
