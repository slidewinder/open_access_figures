abstract: 'The origin and extreme diversification of the animal nervous system is a central question in biology. While most of the attention has traditionally been paid to those lineages with highly elaborated nervous systems (e.g. arthropods, vertebrates, annelids), only the study of the vast animal diversity can deliver a comprehensive view of the evolutionary history of this organ system. In this regard, the phylogenetic position and apparently conservative molecular, morphological and embryological features of priapulid worms (Priapulida) place this animal lineage as a key to understanding the evolution of the Ecdysozoa (i.e. arthropods and nematodes). In this study, we characterize the nervous system of the hatching larva and first lorica larva of the priapulid worm Priapulus caudatus by immunolabelling against acetylated and tyrosinated tubulin, pCaMKII, serotonin and FMRFamide. Our results show that a circumoral brain and an unpaired ventral nerve with a caudal ganglion characterize the central nervous system of hatching embryos. After the first moult, the larva attains some adult features: a neck ganglion, an introvert plexus, and conspicuous secondary longitudinal neurites. Our study delivers a neuroanatomical framework for future embryological studies in priapulid worms, and helps illuminate the course of nervous system evolution in the Ecdysozoa.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The early larval nervous system of *P. caudatus*. (*a,b*) Schematic of the nervous system of the hatching larva and first lorica larva of *P. caudatus*. (*a*) In the hatching larva, the CNS (in orange) consists of a circumoral brain, an unpaired ventral nerve and a caudal ganglion (serotonin- and FLP-positive). In the brain, all serotonin cell bodies localize anterior to the neuropil. From the brain, neurite bundles innervate the scalids. The PNS (in blue) includes neck commissures and nerves connecting the trunk tubuli with the brain. (*b*) In the first lorica larva, the nervous system is more mature. The CNS consists of the circumoral brain, the ventral nerve, and a neck and a caudal ganglion. The brain neuropil is also FLP-positive. The PNS includes secondary nerves innervating the scalids, connecting the brain and the neck ganglion, and innervating the lorica tubuli (also FLP-positive). The epithelium of the buccal cavity is immunoreactive to FLPs. Drawings are not to scale and are lateral views, with the anterior to the top and ventral to the left. an, anus; cb, circumoral brain; cg, caudal ganglion; dg, digestive tract; lt, lorica tubule; mo, mouth; ng, neck ganglion; sc, scalid; tt, trunk tubule; vnc, ventral nerve cord.</p>
