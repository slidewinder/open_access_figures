abstract: 'The male adults of four species of the Chinese Panorpidae in Mecoptera were cytogenetically studied using conventional squashing procedures. The results show that their sex-chromosome system belongs to the XO type, with n = 19 + X(O) in Panorpa emarginata Cheng, 1949 and Panorpa dubia Chou & Wang, 1981, n = 23 + X(O) in Panorpa sp., and n = 20 + X(O) in Neopanorpa lui Chou & Ran, 1981. X chromosomes of these species usually appear dot-shaped in late prophase I and are easily differentiated from autosomal bivalents. Meiosis in these Panorpidae lacks typical diplotene and diakinesis. In late prophase I, pairs of homologous chromosomes remain parallel in a line and show no evidence of crossing-over. Some of them even appear as a single unit because of extremely intimate association, all with a tendency of increasing condensation. The evolutionary significance of their chromosomal differences and the achiasmatic meiosis of Panorpidae are briefly discussed. '
