abstract: 'The origin and extreme diversification of the animal nervous system is a central question in biology. While most of the attention has traditionally been paid to those lineages with highly elaborated nervous systems (e.g. arthropods, vertebrates, annelids), only the study of the vast animal diversity can deliver a comprehensive view of the evolutionary history of this organ system. In this regard, the phylogenetic position and apparently conservative molecular, morphological and embryological features of priapulid worms (Priapulida) place this animal lineage as a key to understanding the evolution of the Ecdysozoa (i.e. arthropods and nematodes). In this study, we characterize the nervous system of the hatching larva and first lorica larva of the priapulid worm Priapulus caudatus by immunolabelling against acetylated and tyrosinated tubulin, pCaMKII, serotonin and FMRFamide. Our results show that a circumoral brain and an unpaired ventral nerve with a caudal ganglion characterize the central nervous system of hatching embryos. After the first moult, the larva attains some adult features: a neck ganglion, an introvert plexus, and conspicuous secondary longitudinal neurites. Our study delivers a neuroanatomical framework for future embryological studies in priapulid worms, and helps illuminate the course of nervous system evolution in the Ecdysozoa.'

### Figure 6
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The diversity of central nervous systems in the Ecdysozoa. Distribution of major anatomical characteristics of the CNS in the different ecdysozoan lineages, compared with the closest relative outgroup (the Spiralia). Ecdysozoan phylogeny according to Pisani *et al.* [<xref rid="RSTB20150050C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Altogether, the distribution of the plotted characters favours considering an unpaired ventral nerve cord as the ancestral architecture of the ecdysozoan nervous system, although the nature of the brain is still unclear. The asterisk in the Kinorhyncha indicates that the ventral nerve cord is unpaired in the trunk and bifurcates anteriorly and posteriorly, as shown in the schematic on the right. The asterisk in the Tardigrada indicates that the ventral cord ganglia are unpaired, but the neurite connections between them are paired, as shown in the schematic on the right. The dashed line uniting the Cycloneuralia indicates that there are contrasting data supporting this grouping (see main text for references). Drawings are not to scale.</p>
