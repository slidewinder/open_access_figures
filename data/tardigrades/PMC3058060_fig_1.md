abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Segmentation is a hallmark of the arthropods; most knowledge about the molecular basis of arthropod segmentation comes from work on the fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this species a hierarchic cascade of segmentation genes subdivides the blastoderm stepwise into single segment wide regions. However, segmentation in the fly is a derived feature since all segments form virtually simultaneously. Conversely, in the vast majority of arthropods the posterior segments form one at a time from a posterior pre-segmental zone. The pair rule genes (PRGs) comprise an important level of the Drosophila segmentation gene cascade and are indeed the first genes that are expressed in typical transverse stripes in the early embryo. Information on expression and function of PRGs outside the insects, however, is scarce. RESULTS: Here we present the expression of the pair rule gene orthologs in the pill millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda: Diplopoda). We find evidence that these genes are involved in segmentation and that components of the hierarchic interaction of the gene network as found in insects may be conserved. We further provide evidence that segments are formed in a single-segment periodicity rather than in pairs of two like in another myriapod, the centipede Strigamia maritima. Finally we show that decoupling of dorsal and ventral segmentation in Glomeris appears already at the level of the PRGs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pair rule gene network is partially conserved among insects and myriapods, some aspects of PRG interaction are, as suggested by expression pattern analysis, convergent, even within the Myriapoda. Conserved expression patterns of PRGs in insects and myriapods, however, may represent ancestral features involved in segmenting the arthropod ancestor.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Phylogenetic analysis of *Glomeris *pair rule gene orthologs**. **(A) **Phylograms of orthologs of the *Drosophila *pair rule genes Even-skipped, Odd-skipped, Odd-paired and Sloppy-paired from various arthropods and the mouse. Closely-related genes from the *Drosophila *genome serve as outgroups. Un-rooted majority rule consensus trees are shown, computed from 1000 intermediate trees produced with the Quartet Puzzling Method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Reliability values are indicated at the edges. Abbreviations for animals: *Cs, Cupiennius salei *(spider); *Dm, Drosophila melanogaster *(fly); *Gm, Glomeris marginata *(millipede*); La, Lithobius atkinsoni *(centipede); *Mm, Mus musculus *(mouse); *Sm; Strigamia maritima *(centipede); *Tribolium castaneum *(beetle). Abbreviations for gene names: LMD, Lame duck; SUG, Sugarbabe; BOWL, Brother of odd with entrails limited; CROC, Crocodile; EVE, Even-skipped; EVX, vertebrate Even-skipped ortholog; FKH, Forkhead; FKHBG, Forkhead box G1; ODD, Odd-skipped; ODDR, Odd-skipped-related; OPA, Odd-paired; OPR, Odd-paired-related; PB, Proboscipedia; SLP, Sloppy-paired; SOB, Sister of odd and bowl. (**B) **Alignment of Runt, Hairy and Paired sequences. Orthologs from *Drosophila melanogaster*, *Tribolium castaneum*, *Cupiennius salei *and mouse are aligned with the available *Glomeris marginata *gene fragments. Aligned is part of the Runt domain and the C-terminal consensus (for Runt); part of the bHLH domain and the orange domain (for Hairy); part of the Paired domain, the octapeptide and part of the homeodomain (for Paired/Pairberry). Dashes denote identical amino acids, dots indicate gaps introduced to improve the alignment. Question marks stand for missing sequence information. Species abbreviations as in (A). Gene name abbreviations as in (A). Additional abbreviations: DPN, Deadpan; GSB, Gooseberry; GSBN, Gooseberry-neuro; Pax3/7, Pax group III genes; PRD, Paired; H, Hairy; HES, Hairy/Enhancer of split; LZ, Lozenge; PBY, Pairberry; RUN, Runt.</p>
