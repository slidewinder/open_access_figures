abstract: 'Upon desiccation, some tardigrades enter an ametabolic dehydrated state called anhydrobiosis and can survive a desiccated environment in this state. For successful transition to anhydrobiosis, some anhydrobiotic tardigrades require pre-incubation under high humidity conditions, a process called preconditioning, prior to exposure to severe desiccation. Although tardigrades are thought to prepare for transition to anhydrobiosis during preconditioning, the molecular mechanisms governing such processes remain unknown. In this study, we used chemical genetic approaches to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of anhydrobiosis in the anhydrobiotic tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini. We first demonstrated that inhibition of transcription or translation drastically impaired anhydrobiotic survival, suggesting that de novo gene expression is required for successful transition to anhydrobiosis in this tardigrade. We then screened 81 chemicals and identified 5 chemicals that significantly impaired anhydrobiotic survival after severe desiccation, in contrast to little or no effect on survival after high humidity exposure only. In particular, cantharidic acid, a selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and PP2A, exhibited the most profound inhibitory effects. Another PP1/PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, also significantly and specifically impaired anhydrobiotic survival, suggesting that PP1/PP2A activity plays an important role for anhydrobiosis in this species. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the required activities of signaling molecules for desiccation tolerance in tardigrades. The identified inhibitory chemicals could provide novel clues to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades.'

<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Screening of chemicals inhibiting anhydrobiotic survival.</title> (A) Experimental scheme used for chemical screening. (B-I) The effects of various chemicals on anhydrobiotic survival in the four experimental groups that contained the chemicals that significantly inhibited anhydrobiotic survival. Significant inhibitory effects were detected for chemicals #49 (J-8) and #52 (triptolide) of Group 12 (B, C); chemical #60 (MNS) of Group 13 (D); chemical #77 (cantharidic acid) of Group 16 (F, G); and chemical #78 (2-APB) of Group 17 (H). At 24 h after rehydration, no significant inhibitory effects of chemical #60 of Group 13 and chemical #78 of Group 17 were detected (E, I). Recovery rates are shown as percent of DMSO control. Mean ± SD (N = 4; 30 tardigrades each). In each group, statistically significant differences from the DMSO control were determined by Dunnett’s test (Groups 12 and 13) or Student’s *t*-test (Groups 16 and 17), **, *P*&lt;0.01.</p>
