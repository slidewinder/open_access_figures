abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Systematic comparisons between genomic sequence datasets have revealed a wide spectrum of sequence specificity from sequences that are highly conserved to those that are specific to individual species. Due to the limited number of fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes, analyses of this spectrum have largely focused on prokaryotes. Combining existing genomic datasets with the partial genomes of 193 eukaryotes derived from collections of expressed sequence tags, we performed a quantitative analysis of the sequence specificity spectrum to provide a global view of the origins and extent of sequence diversity across the three domains of life. RESULTS: Comparisons with prokaryotic datasets reveal a greater genetic diversity within eukaryotes that may be related to differences in modes of genetic inheritance. Mapping this diversity within a phylogenetic framework revealed that the majority of sequences are either highly conserved or specific to the species or taxon from which they derive. Between these two extremes, several evolutionary landmarks consisting of large numbers of sequences conserved within specific taxonomic groups were identified. For example, 8% of sequences derived from metazoan species are specific and conserved within the metazoan lineage. Many of these sequences likely mediate metazoan specific functions, such as cell-cell communication and differentiation. CONCLUSION: Through the use of partial genome datasets, this study provides a unique perspective of sequence conservation across the three domains of life. The provision of taxon restricted sequences should prove valuable for future computational and biochemical analyses aimed at understanding evolutionary and functional relationships.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Taxonomic distribution and functional analysis of genes from fully sequenced genomes. On the basis of a raw BLAST score cutoff of 50, we determined the number of sequences with similarity of sequences derived from the three domains of life. **(a) **The Venn diagram shows the proportion of sequences associated with each group. Numbers in grey boxes show the proportion of sequences specific to their parent domain; numbers in white boxes show the proportion of sequences that are shared with one or more members of the same domain. The numbers in the overlapping regions of the diagram show the proportion of sequences shared between the overlapping domains: yellow, archaeal sequences; blue, bacteria; red, eukaryotes. **(b) **Pie charts showing the proportion of each functional category for three datasets of sequences: highly conserved sequences (with sequence similarity to every other complete genome dataset); semi-conserved sequences (with similarity to at least one species from each of the three domains of life); and sequences unique to a genome (possessing no similarity to any other genome dataset). Functional categories were assigned with reference to the KEGG database (see Materials and methods).</p>
