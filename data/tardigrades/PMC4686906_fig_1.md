abstract: 'Upon desiccation, some tardigrades enter an ametabolic dehydrated state called anhydrobiosis and can survive a desiccated environment in this state. For successful transition to anhydrobiosis, some anhydrobiotic tardigrades require pre-incubation under high humidity conditions, a process called preconditioning, prior to exposure to severe desiccation. Although tardigrades are thought to prepare for transition to anhydrobiosis during preconditioning, the molecular mechanisms governing such processes remain unknown. In this study, we used chemical genetic approaches to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of anhydrobiosis in the anhydrobiotic tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini. We first demonstrated that inhibition of transcription or translation drastically impaired anhydrobiotic survival, suggesting that de novo gene expression is required for successful transition to anhydrobiosis in this tardigrade. We then screened 81 chemicals and identified 5 chemicals that significantly impaired anhydrobiotic survival after severe desiccation, in contrast to little or no effect on survival after high humidity exposure only. In particular, cantharidic acid, a selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and PP2A, exhibited the most profound inhibitory effects. Another PP1/PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, also significantly and specifically impaired anhydrobiotic survival, suggesting that PP1/PP2A activity plays an important role for anhydrobiosis in this species. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of the required activities of signaling molecules for desiccation tolerance in tardigrades. The identified inhibitory chemicals could provide novel clues to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades.'

<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Effects of preconditioning conditions on anhydrobiotic survival in Z151 strain of *H*. *dujardini*.</title> (A) Experimental scheme of the desiccation tolerance assay. Tardigrades in aqueous fluid were dropped onto a nylon filter placed on filter paper, and preconditioned at 95% RH for 0 to 4 days. After preconditioning, they were desiccated at 10% RH for 2 days and humidified at 95% RH for 1 day prior to rehydration. Recovery rates were examined at 1 h after rehydration. (B, C) Effects of various preconditioning periods on anhydrobiotic survival at 1h (B) and 24h (C). Data are shown as mean ± SD (N = 4; 20 tardigrades each). (D, E) Effects of relative humidity exposure during preconditioning on anhydrobiotic survival at 1h (D) and 24h (E). The preconditioning period was fixed as 1 day, and tardigrades were exposed to 33.5%, 62%, 85%, or 95% RH as preconditioning. Data are shown as mean ± SD (N = 4; 20 tardigrades each).</p>
