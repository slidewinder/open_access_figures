abstract: 'Knowledge on neuropeptide receptor systems is integral to understanding animal physiology. Yet, obtaining general insight into neuropeptide signalling in a clade as biodiverse as the insects is problematic. Here we apply fluorescent analogues of three key insect neuropeptides to map renal tissue architecture across systematically chosen representatives of the major insect Orders, to provide an unprecedented overview of insect renal function and control. In endopterygote insects, such as Drosophila, two distinct transporting cell types receive separate neuropeptide signals, whereas in the ancestral exopterygotes, a single, general cell type mediates all signals. Intriguingly, the largest insect Order Coleoptera (beetles) has evolved a unique approach, in which only a small fraction of cells are targets for neuropeptide action. In addition to demonstrating a universal utility of this technology, our results reveal not only a generality of signalling by the evolutionarily ancient neuropeptide families but also a clear functional separation of the types of cells that mediate the signal.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>*Drosophila* kinin binding predicts diuretic activity across species.</title> Percent change of basal rates of fluid secretion following stimulation with DK-F or DK on MTs from (**a**) *D. melanogaster* (**b**) *G. morsitans*, (**c**) *A. gambiae*, (**d**) *M. sexta*, (**e**) *P. marginata*, (**f**) *T. molitor*, (**g**) *V. vulgaris* and (**h**) *G. assimilis*. Values are expressed as mean±s.e.m. Significant difference from basal rates of fluid secretion immediately before peptide application compared with 30 min after stimulation was tested using a paired-samples *t*-test, while an unpaired two-sample *t*-test was used to test differences in secretory response between DK-F and DK treatments. In both cases, a significance level of **P*&lt;0.05 was taken as the critical value. NS, not significant.</p>
