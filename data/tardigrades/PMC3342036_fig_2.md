abstract: "An emerging picture of the nature of immune systems across animal phyla reveals both conservatism of some features and the appearance among and within phyla of novel, lineage-specific defense solutions. The latter collectively represent a major and underappreciated form of animal diversity. Factors influencing this macroevolutionary (above the species level) pattern of novelty are considered and include adoption of different life styles, life histories, and body plans; a general advantage of being distinctive with respect to immune defenses; and the responses required to cope with parasites, many of which afflict hosts in a lineage-specific manner. This large-scale pattern of novelty implies that immunological phenomena can affect microevolutionary processes (at the population level within species) that can eventually lead to macroevolutionary events such as speciation, radiations, or extinctions. Immunologically based phenomena play a role in favoring intraspecific diversification, specialization and host specificity of parasites, and mechanisms are discussed whereby this could lead to parasite speciation. Host switching - the acquisition of new host species by parasites - is a major mechanism that drives parasite diversity and is frequently involved in disease emergence. It is also one that can be favored by reductions in immune competence of new hosts. Mechanisms involving immune phenomena favoring intraspecific diversification and speciation of host species are also discussed. A macroevolutionary perspective on immunology is invaluable in today's world, including the need to study a broader range of species with distinctive immune systems. Many of these species are faced with extinction, another macroevolutionary process influenced by immune phenomena."

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**One scenario for early in the divergence of animals is that different lineages (A–D) have fundamentally similar immune systems such that they all are colonized by the same parasites**. In the case shown at the top, an immunological innovation occurred in lineage A, that allowed it to resist these parasites. This may have permitted a subsequent radiation in “parasite-free space” in this host lineage. At the bottom, lineage D has acquired a lineage-specific parasite different from those previously experienced. This requires an immunological accommodation that causes the immune system of lineage D1 to diverge. Both the host lineage and the lineage-specific parasites along with them may subsequently diverge.</p>
