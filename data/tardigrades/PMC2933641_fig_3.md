abstract: ' BACKGROUND: The composition of the arthropod head is one of the most contentious issues in animal evolution. In particular, controversy surrounds the homology and innervation of segmental cephalic appendages by the brain. Onychophora (velvet worms) play a crucial role in understanding the evolution of the arthropod brain, because they are close relatives of arthropods and have apparently changed little since the Early Cambrian. However, the segmental origins of their brain neuropils and the number of cephalic appendages innervated by the brain--key issues in clarifying brain composition in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda--remain unclear. RESULTS: Using immunolabelling and neuronal tracing techniques in the developing and adult onychophoran brain, we found that the major brain neuropils arise from only the anterior-most body segment, and that two pairs of segmental appendages are innervated by the brain. The region of the central nervous system corresponding to the arthropod tritocerebrum is not differentiated as part of the onychophoran brain but instead belongs to the ventral nerve cords. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contradict the assumptions of a tripartite (three-segmented) brain in Onychophora and instead confirm the hypothesis of bipartite (two-segmented) brain composition. They suggest that the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda possessed a brain consisting of protocerebrum and deutocerebrum whereas the tritocerebrum evolved in arthropods.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Development of major neuropils in the onychophoran brain**. Heads of embryos at progressively older developmental stages in dorsal view. Anti-acetylated α-tubulin immunolabelling. Confocal maximum projections (A, B) and depth-coded projections (C, D). Anterior is up. (A) Central neuropil (cn) arises from a single transverse commissure in the antennal segment in an early *Euperipatoides rowelli *embryo. Scale bar: 200 μm. (B-D) Further stages of brain development in embryos of *Epiperipatus isthmicola*. Scale bars: 100 μm. A second transverse neuropil (arrowhead in B) and a third neuropil (arrowheads in C and D) arise anterior to the original commissure. Abbreviations: an, antennal nerve; at, antenna; cn, developing central brain neuropil; jw, jaw anlage; np, future nerve cord neuropil; ph, pharynx; sp, slime papilla.</p>
