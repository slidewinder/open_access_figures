abstract: 'Lake Vostok is the largest of the nearly 400 subglacial Antarctic lakes and has been continuously buried by glacial ice for 15 million years. Extreme cold, heat (from possible hydrothermal activity), pressure (from the overriding glacier) and dissolved oxygen (delivered by melting meteoric ice), in addition to limited nutrients and complete darkness, combine to produce one of the most extreme environments on Earth. Metagenomic/metatranscriptomic analyses of ice that accreted over a shallow embayment and over the southern main lake basin indicate the presence of thousands of species of organisms (94% Bacteria, 6% Eukarya, and two Archaea). The predominant bacterial sequences were closest to those from species of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while the predominant eukaryotic sequences were most similar to those from species of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous Fungi. Based on the sequence data, the lake appears to contain a mixture of autotrophs and heterotrophs capable of performing nitrogen fixation, nitrogen cycling, carbon fixation and nutrient recycling. Sequences closest to those of psychrophiles and thermophiles indicate a cold lake with possible hydrothermal activity. Sequences most similar to those from marine and aquatic species suggest the presence of marine and freshwater regions.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Sea level changes relative to the current level of water in Lake Vostok (based on reference [<xref rid="B24-biology-02-00629" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). (**a**) Current mean sea level. Blue indicates areas below sea level if all of the ice was removed. Light green indicates areas above sea level. The upper surface of Lake Vostok (black region) is approximately 200 m below current sea level; (**b**) View of the same region with a 50 m sea level rise. Current outline of Lake Vostok is indicated by the dashed line; (**c**) View of the same region with a 100 m sea level rise.</p>
