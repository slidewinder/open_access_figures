abstract: 'The impact of abiotic stress on plant growth and development has been and still is a major research topic. An important pathway that has been linked to abiotic stress tolerance is the trehalose biosynthetic pathway. Recent findings showed that trehalose metabolism is also important for normal plant growth and development. The intermediate compound - trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) - is now confirmed to act as a sensor for available sucrose, hereby directly influencing the type of response to the changing environmental conditions. This is possible because T6P and/or trehalose or their biosynthetic enzymes are part of complex interaction networks with other crucial hormone and sugar-induced signaling pathways, which may function at different developmental stages. Because of its effect on plant growth and development, modification of trehalose biosynthesis, either at the level of T6P synthesis, T6P hydrolysis, or trehalose hydrolysis, has been utilized to try to improve crop yield and biomass. It was shown that alteration of the amounts of either T6P and/or trehalose did result in increased stress tolerance, but also resulted in many unexpected phenotypic alterations. A main challenge is to characterize the part of the signaling pathway resulting in improved stress tolerance, without affecting the pathways resulting in the unwanted phenotypes. One such specific pathway where modification of trehalose metabolism improved stress tolerance, without any side effects, was recently obtained by overexpression of trehalase, which results in a more sensitive reaction of the stomatal guard cells and closing of the stomata under drought stress conditions. We have used the data that have been obtained from different studies to generate the optimal plant that can be constructed based on modifications of trehalose metabolism.'

<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Transgenic plants in trehalose metabolism: toward an optimized approach for stress tolerant plants. (A)***OtsA* OX plants contain high levels of T6P. They develop poor seed set, experience reduced apical dominance, flower early and display reduced rosette and darker, lancet shaped leaves. In tobacco *OtsA* OX, root development is disturbed, showing thicker roots. In Chinese cabbage plants *OtsA* OX, thicker roots, well developed lateral roots and extensive root hairs were noticed. In general, these plants are better stress tolerant (based on <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Goddijn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Schluepmann et al., 2003</xref>). **(B)** *OtsB* OX plants contain low levels of T6P. These plants show opposite phenotypes to **(A)**. They develop plenty of seeds, they have distinct apical dominance, flower later, and they have a larger, paler-green rosette (based on <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Schluepmann et al., 2003</xref>). **(C)** Model for optimized transgenic trehalose metabolism plant. This plant has a controlled cellular level of T6P. This optimized model is the result of many factors; use of bifunctional constructs, use of condition specific promoters (for instance stress specific, depending on the destined region where the crop will be grown), use of cell-specific promoters (for instance in stomata, using TRE1 as target gene). In addition, this plant contains optimized constructs, yet unrevealed, connected to abiotic stress tolerance via trehalose metabolism. Ideally, this plant will be tolerant toward a wide range of abiotic stresses, generating high biomass, continuing growth in deteriorated circumstances, generating fertile seeds, and requiring little need for any other kind of maintenance (based on <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Karim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Van Houtte et al., 2013a</xref>).</p>
