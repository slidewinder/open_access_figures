abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Segmentation is a hallmark of the arthropods; most knowledge about the molecular basis of arthropod segmentation comes from work on the fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this species a hierarchic cascade of segmentation genes subdivides the blastoderm stepwise into single segment wide regions. However, segmentation in the fly is a derived feature since all segments form virtually simultaneously. Conversely, in the vast majority of arthropods the posterior segments form one at a time from a posterior pre-segmental zone. The pair rule genes (PRGs) comprise an important level of the Drosophila segmentation gene cascade and are indeed the first genes that are expressed in typical transverse stripes in the early embryo. Information on expression and function of PRGs outside the insects, however, is scarce. RESULTS: Here we present the expression of the pair rule gene orthologs in the pill millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda: Diplopoda). We find evidence that these genes are involved in segmentation and that components of the hierarchic interaction of the gene network as found in insects may be conserved. We further provide evidence that segments are formed in a single-segment periodicity rather than in pairs of two like in another myriapod, the centipede Strigamia maritima. Finally we show that decoupling of dorsal and ventral segmentation in Glomeris appears already at the level of the PRGs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pair rule gene network is partially conserved among insects and myriapods, some aspects of PRG interaction are, as suggested by expression pattern analysis, convergent, even within the Myriapoda. Conserved expression patterns of PRGs in insects and myriapods, however, may represent ancestral features involved in segmenting the arthropod ancestor.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Schematic summary of *Glomeris *pair rule gene expression patterns in dorsal and ventral segments**. Segmental expression of PRG orthologs in young **(A, B) **and older **(C, D) **segments. (B) and (D) represent ventral segments, (A) and (C) represent dorsal segments. The genes are denoted in different colors and patterns and are explained in the legend below the drawings. Note that expression of the primary PRGs *eve *and *run *is present in the nascent segments, but absent from older segments, both in ventral and dorsal tissue. The patterning of dorsal and ventral segments is very different at the level of the PRGs. Some genes are exclusively expressed in dorsal or ventral segments, respectively (for example, *odd*, *pby1*, *opa*). Other genes are expressed in both ventral and dorsal segments, but show differences in their temporal expression profile or their intrasegmental position (for example, *eve*, *run*, *h1*). These results support earlier results that suggested a decoupling between dorsal and ventral segments, and indicate that this decoupling is already present at the level of the PRGs.
