abstract: 'Knowledge on neuropeptide receptor systems is integral to understanding animal physiology. Yet, obtaining general insight into neuropeptide signalling in a clade as biodiverse as the insects is problematic. Here we apply fluorescent analogues of three key insect neuropeptides to map renal tissue architecture across systematically chosen representatives of the major insect Orders, to provide an unprecedented overview of insect renal function and control. In endopterygote insects, such as Drosophila, two distinct transporting cell types receive separate neuropeptide signals, whereas in the ancestral exopterygotes, a single, general cell type mediates all signals. Intriguingly, the largest insect Order Coleoptera (beetles) has evolved a unique approach, in which only a small fraction of cells are targets for neuropeptide action. In addition to demonstrating a universal utility of this technology, our results reveal not only a generality of signalling by the evolutionarily ancient neuropeptide families but also a clear functional separation of the types of cells that mediate the signal.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>The receptor-binding assay is a tool to probe insect biodiversity.</title> Application of DK-F (10<sup>−7</sup> M) to insect MTs maps kinin receptors to a distinct cell type (arrows) in all endopterygote insects, such as (**a**) *G. morsitans* (Diptera), (**b**) *T. oleracea* (Diptera), (**c**) *A. gambiae* (Diptera), (**d**) *M. sexta* (Lepidoptera), (**e**) *B. mori* (Lepidoptera) and (**j**) *V. vulgaris* (Hymenoptera). In contrast, no staining was observed in tubules of the coleopterans (**f**) *P. marginata*, (**g**) *T. castaneum*, (**h**) *T. molitor* or (**i**) *Hylobios abietis*. In the exopterygote species, kinin receptors localize throughout the length of the tubule, as in (**k**) *P. spumarius* and (**m**) *G. assimilis*, or to circular muscle cells like in (**l**) *M. persicae* (secondarily lost MTs). Notably, the MT anatomy of *M. sexta* larvae is characterized by dome-like structures protruding throughout the length of the tubule, with each ‘dome' constituting a single cell containing a highly branched nucleus. Some of these ‘domes' demonstrated kinin-reactivity reminiscent of the leptophragmata cells in the cryptonephridial system of *T. molitor*<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The image shown represents an optical section made through one of these ‘domes' to emphasize basolateral localization of the DK-F signal. In all species tested, excess unlabelled peptide (+DK) greatly reduced the fluorescent signal. Yellow line separates the endopterygote and exopterygote species tested. PS, proximal segment; MS, main segment. Scale bar, 25 μm in (**a**–**c**), (**j**) and (**l**). Scale bar, 50 μm in (**d**–**i**), (**k**) and (**m**).</p>
