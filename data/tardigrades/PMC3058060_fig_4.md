abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Segmentation is a hallmark of the arthropods; most knowledge about the molecular basis of arthropod segmentation comes from work on the fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this species a hierarchic cascade of segmentation genes subdivides the blastoderm stepwise into single segment wide regions. However, segmentation in the fly is a derived feature since all segments form virtually simultaneously. Conversely, in the vast majority of arthropods the posterior segments form one at a time from a posterior pre-segmental zone. The pair rule genes (PRGs) comprise an important level of the Drosophila segmentation gene cascade and are indeed the first genes that are expressed in typical transverse stripes in the early embryo. Information on expression and function of PRGs outside the insects, however, is scarce. RESULTS: Here we present the expression of the pair rule gene orthologs in the pill millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda: Diplopoda). We find evidence that these genes are involved in segmentation and that components of the hierarchic interaction of the gene network as found in insects may be conserved. We further provide evidence that segments are formed in a single-segment periodicity rather than in pairs of two like in another myriapod, the centipede Strigamia maritima. Finally we show that decoupling of dorsal and ventral segmentation in Glomeris appears already at the level of the PRGs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pair rule gene network is partially conserved among insects and myriapods, some aspects of PRG interaction are, as suggested by expression pattern analysis, convergent, even within the Myriapoda. Conserved expression patterns of PRGs in insects and myriapods, however, may represent ancestral features involved in segmenting the arthropod ancestor.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Expression of *Glomeris hairy-1*, *odd-paired*, *odd-skipped*, *sloppy-paired *and *pairberry-1***. Expression of *hairy-1 *(*h1*) (**A-C**), *odd-paired *(*opa*) (**D-F**), *odd-skipped *(*odd*) (**G-I**), *sloppy-paired *(*slp*) (**J-L**) and *pairberry-1 *(*pby-1*) (**M-O**). (**A**) Stage 1.1 embryo. Arrow points to antennal segment that does not express *h1 *at this stage. Asterisk marks weaker expression near the ventral midline. (**B**) Stage 1.2 embryo. Asterisk as in (A). Note that the segmental expression proceeds into the extra-embryonic tissue (filled circle). Enhanced patch-like expression in the central nervous system (CNS) (arrowhead), the ocular region (oc) and the antennal segment (arrow). (**C) **Stage 3 embryo. Segmental stripes are restricted to dorsal tissue (arrow). Dotted expression in the CNS (arrowhead) and in the anal valves (asterisk). (**D) **Stage 1.2 embryo. (**E**) Stage 2 embryo. Expression is dis-continuous in the anterior segments (arrow). (**F**) Stage 3 embryo. Note that expression is restricted to ventral tissue only. (**G**) Stage 2 embryo. Asterisk marks dynamic expression in the SAZ. Arrowhead points to dorsal segmental stripes. White arrow points to ventral segmental stripes. Black arrow points to expression in the proctodaeum. (**H**) Stage 3 embryo. Note the transformation of the SAZ-expression (asterisk in (G)) into dorsal patches (asterisk in H) in parallel with a clearance of expression from the SAZ. Arrows and arrowhead as in (G). (**I**) Stage 4 embryo. Transformation of the dorsal patches (asterisk in (H)) into a dorsal stripe (asterisk in (I)). Arrows and arrowhead as in (G) and (H). (**J**) Stage 1.1 embryo. (**K**) Stage 1.2 embryo. (**L**) Stage 4 embryo. Segmental expression is reduced to the ventral midline (arrow), the ventral part of the appendages and small segmental domains in the CNS (arrowhead). (**M**) Stage 2 embryo. Note that expression does not extend into the appendage buds, except for the mandibles (black arrow). (**N**) Stage 3 embryo. Enhanced expression in the CNS (white arrow). Black arrow as in (M). (**O**) Stage 4 embryo. Arrows as in (N). Anterior is to the left in all pictures. Abbreviations as in Figure 2. Additional abbreviations: av, anal valves; S, stomodaeum</p>
