abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Onychophora are a probable sister group to Arthropoda, one of the most intensively studied animal phyla from a developmental perspective. Pioneering work on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and subsequent investigation of other arthropods has revealed important roles for Wnt genes during many developmental processes in these animals. RESULTS: We screened the embryonic transcriptome of the onychophoran Euperipatoides kanangrensis and found that at least 11 Wnt genes are expressed during embryogenesis. These genes represent 11 of the 13 known subfamilies of Wnt genes. CONCLUSIONS: Many onychophoran Wnt genes are expressed in segment polarity gene-like patterns, suggesting a general role for these ligands during segment regionalization, as has been described in arthropods. During early stages of development, Wnt2, Wnt4, and Wnt5 are expressed in broad multiple segment-wide domains that are reminiscent of arthropod gap and Hox gene expression patterns, which suggests an early instructive role for Wnt genes during E. kanangrensis segmentation.'

### Figure 13
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Segment polarity gene-like intrasegmental expression.** The slime-papillae-bearing segment is represented (broad black lines) in embryos older than stage 10. The positions of the slime papillae are indicated by transverse broad black lines. Thin black lines mark intrasegmental borders of *Wnt* gene expression. The grey circle marks the position of the salivary gland. Arrows point to the position of the parasegment boundary and the two possible positions of the segmental boundary. Expression of *Wnt* genes is indicated by coloured bars. Positions of expression of the segment polarity genes *engrailed* (*en*) and *hedgehog* (*hh*) are indicated by dark grey (co-expression of *en* + *hh*) and light grey (expression of *en*) bars. Drawing is out of scale. PSB, parasegment boundary; SB?, possible position of segmental boundary; sg, salivary gland.</p>
