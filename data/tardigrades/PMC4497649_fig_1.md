abstract: 'Three issues are critical for successful cryopreservation of multicellular material: gases dissolved in liquid, thermal conductivity of the tissue, and localization of microstructures. Here we show that heat distribution is controlled by the gas amount dissolved in liquids and that when changing the liquid into solid, the dissolved gases either form bubbles due to the absence of space in the lattice of solids and/or are migrated toward the concentrated salt and sugar solution at the cost of amount of heat required to be removed to complete a solid-state transition. These factors affect the heat distribution in the organs to be cryopreserved. We show that the gas concentration issue controls fracturing of ice when freezing. There are volumetric changes not only when changing the liquid into solid (volume increases) but also reduction of the volume when reaching lower temperatures (volume decreases). We discuss these issues parallel with observations of the cryosurvivability of multicellular organisms, tardigrades, and discuss their analogy for cryopreservation of large organs.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Slab of water was cooled down toward the liquid nitrogen temperature. Left image shows transmission of light through the 0.5-mm-thick slab (1×4.5 cm) of deionized water. Following panels show development of ice fractures in cross-polarized light. Decreasing temperature value is shown under each image. Cooling rate for this process was about 1 K/min.</p>
