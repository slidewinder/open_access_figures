abstract: 'Larvae of an anhydrobiotic insect, Polypedilum vanderplanki, accumulate very large amounts of trehalose as a compatible solute on desiccation, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this accumulation are unclear. We therefore isolated the genes coding for trehalose metabolism enzymes, i.e. trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) for the synthesis step, and trehalase (TREH) for the degradation step. Although computational prediction indicated that the alternative splicing variants (PvTpsα/β) obtained encoded probable functional motifs consisting of a typical consensus domain of TPS and a conserved sequence of TPP, PvTpsα did not exert activity as TPP, but only as TPS. Instead, a distinct gene (PvTpp) obtained expressed TPP activity. Previous reports have suggested that insect TPS is, exceptionally, a bifunctional enzyme governing both TPS and TPP. In this article, we propose that TPS and TPP activities in insects can be attributed to discrete genes. The translated product of the TREH ortholog (PvTreh) certainly degraded trehalose to glucose. Trehalose was synthesized abundantly, consistent with increased activities of TPS and TPP and suppressed TREH activity. These results show that trehalose accumulation observed during anhydrobiosis induction in desiccating larvae can be attributed to the activation of the trehalose synthetic pathway and to the depression of trehalose hydrolysis.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Complementation assay using yeast deletion mutants. (A) Complementation of *S. cerevisiae tps1* deletion mutant by *PvTpsα/β*. Yeast cells were grown on a plate containing YP medium with galactose (YPGal) under hyperosmotic conditions (1 <sc>m</sc> NaCl, 50% sucrose and 1.5 <sc>m</sc> sorbitol). (B) Complementation of *S. cerevisiae tps2* deletion by *PvTpp*. Yeast cells were plated on SD agar medium containing galactose and lacking uracil and methionine. To confirm whether the transformants rescued thermosensitivity, yeasts were incubated at 45 °C for 5 h and then grown at 30 °C. Representative results of three independent experiments are shown.</p>
