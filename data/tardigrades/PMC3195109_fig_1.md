abstract: " BACKGROUND: Nematodes can be subdivided into basal Enoplea (clades 1 and 2) and more derived Chromadorea (clades 3 to 12). Embryogenesis of Caenorhabditis elegans (clade 9) has been analyzed in most detail. Their establishment of polarity and asymmetric cleavage requires the differential localization of PAR proteins. Earlier studies on selected other nematodes revealed that embryonic development of nematodes is more diverse than the essentially invariant development of C. elegans and the classic study object Ascaris had suggested. To obtain a more detailed picture of variations and evolutionary trends we compared embryonic cell lineages and pattern formation in embryos of all 12 nematode clades. METHODS: The study was conducted using 4-D microscopy and 3-D modeling of developing embryos. RESULTS: We found dramatic differences compared to C. elegans in Enoplea but also considerable variations among Chromadorea. We discovered 'Polarity Organizing Centers' (POCs) that orient cleavage spindles along the anterior-posterior axis in distinct cells over consecutive cell generations. The resulting lineally arranged blastomeres represent a starting point for the establishment of bilateral symmetry within individual lineages. We can discern six different early cleavage types and suggest that these variations are due to modifications in the activity of the POCs in conjunction with changes in the distribution of PAR proteins. In addition, our studies indicate that lineage complexity advanced considerably during evolution, that is we observe trends towards an increase of somatic founder cells, from monoclonal to polyclonal lineages and from a variable (position-dependent) to an invariable (lineage-dependent) way of cell fate specification. In contrast to the early phase of embryogenesis, the second half ('morphogenesis') appears similar in all studied nematodes. Comparison of early cleavage between the basal nematode Tobrilus stefanskii and the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini revealed surprising similarities indicating that the presence of POCs is not restricted to nematode embryos. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cleavage, spatial arrangement and differentiation of cells diverged dramatically during the history of the phylum Nematoda without corresponding changes in the phenotype. While in all studied representatives the same distinctive developmental steps need to be taken, cell behavior leading to these is not conserved."

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Phylogeny and development**. **a**. Phylogenetic tree of nematodes (after [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; clade 9 after [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]) with species whose embryogenesis is compared here. Different colors of lineage branches indicate distinct early cleavage patterns as indicated in Figure 1b. Individual clades (1 to 12) are marked with red numbers. Clades 4 and 5 are not included due to fragmentary data (see results). Based on distinct developmental characters described in the text some clades are further subdivided (A, B, C). Data of species written in grey have been extracted from the literature. References are given in the text. **b**. Six early cleavage types. Color of lettering corresponds to lineage branches where this pattern is found. Division of 2 to 4 cells (top) and origin and relative position of alimentary tract (Enoplea) or gut (Chromadorea) precursor (yellow) and germline cell P3 (red) generated with the next division are shown. **c**. Alignment of early blastomeres (colored circles) along the a-p axis. Colored columns indicate fate assignments ('AB' = AB-like and so on, for definition, see materials and methods). From clade 2C onward all early blastomeres can be assigned one of the six basic fates, however the position in the sequence of cells varies between species. Striated area indicates that in *Prionchulus *S3-S5 form largely bilaterally symmetric clones (for further description, see text). In some Chromadorea the initial order of founder cells is different to that in *C. elegans *due to the absence of PR in the germline. After cellular rearrangements ('cell sorting') they all merge into a single, standard pattern prior to the onset of gastrulation. PR, polarity reversal in the germline.</p>
