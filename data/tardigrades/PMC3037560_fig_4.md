abstract: 'Larvae of an anhydrobiotic insect, Polypedilum vanderplanki, accumulate very large amounts of trehalose as a compatible solute on desiccation, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this accumulation are unclear. We therefore isolated the genes coding for trehalose metabolism enzymes, i.e. trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) for the synthesis step, and trehalase (TREH) for the degradation step. Although computational prediction indicated that the alternative splicing variants (PvTpsα/β) obtained encoded probable functional motifs consisting of a typical consensus domain of TPS and a conserved sequence of TPP, PvTpsα did not exert activity as TPP, but only as TPS. Instead, a distinct gene (PvTpp) obtained expressed TPP activity. Previous reports have suggested that insect TPS is, exceptionally, a bifunctional enzyme governing both TPS and TPP. In this article, we propose that TPS and TPP activities in insects can be attributed to discrete genes. The translated product of the TREH ortholog (PvTreh) certainly degraded trehalose to glucose. Trehalose was synthesized abundantly, consistent with increased activities of TPS and TPP and suppressed TREH activity. These results show that trehalose accumulation observed during anhydrobiosis induction in desiccating larvae can be attributed to the activation of the trehalose synthetic pathway and to the depression of trehalose hydrolysis.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Functional analyses of PvTPSα, PvTPSβ, PvTPP and PvTREH proteins. (A, C) Confirmation of protein production by *in vitro* transcription and translation (A: PvTPSα, PvTPSβ and PvTPP; C: PvTREH). Aliquots of non-labeled or [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and western blotting (A) or autoradiography (C). (B, D) HPLC analyses of the resultant products from enzymatic assays for TPP (B) and TREH (D). Arrowhead indicates the position of the target protein. Arrows represent the elution positions of trehalose and glucose. (E) Trehalose estimation in yeast transformants. Top: the ability to produce trehalose was evaluated in each yeast strain transformed with *PvTpsα/β*-containing vector. Bottom: western blot analysis of PvTPSα/β expression. Total protein was extracted from the aliquot of the culture used for trehalose measurement and subjected to SDS/PAGE and western blotting with anti-PvTPS IgG.</p>
