abstract: 'Massive water loss is a serious challenge for terrestrial animals, which usually has fatal consequences. However, some organisms have developed means to survive this stress by entering an ametabolic state called anhydrobiosis. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. We recently showed that Caenorhabditis elegans dauer larva, an arrested stage specialized for survival in adverse conditions, is resistant to severe desiccation. However, this requires a preconditioning step at a mild desiccative environment to prepare the organism for harsher desiccation conditions. A systems approach was used to identify factors that are activated during this preconditioning. Using microarray analysis, proteomics, and bioinformatics, genes, proteins, and biochemical pathways that are upregulated during this process were identified. These pathways were validated via reverse genetics by testing the desiccation tolerances of mutants. These data show that the desiccation response is activated by hygrosensation (sensing the desiccative environment) via head neurons. This leads to elimination of reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, expression of heat shock and intrinsically disordered proteins, polyamine utilization, and induction of fatty acid desaturation pathway. Remarkably, this response is specific and involves a small number of functional pathways, which represent the generic toolkit for anhydrobiosis in plants and animals.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Analysis of desiccation-induced DTR mRNAs.</title> (A) Fold change clustering of upregulated (green area) and downregulated (pink area) genes. The very low FCC was discarded because the differential expression was too low. The number of genes (*n*) in each group is shown. (B) Hierarchical clustering of the 64 highly upregulated genes (blue region in panel A). Red/green column shows log<sub>2</sub> expression levels before (–) and after (+) preconditioning, cyan column shows log<sub>2</sub> fold changes for the genes indicated on the right. Color codes for the heat map are shown top left. Main branches of the dendrogram are labeled ‘a’ (light gray) and ‘b’ (dark gray, see the text for details). Highlighted genes reside in essential anhydrobiotic pathways shown in the legend with unique color codes, which are consistent in the following figures. (C) The trehalose biosynthesis pathway is upregulated in *C*. *elegans* upon desiccation stress. Enzymes that catalyze each reaction are shown with the corresponding differential expression values of their transcripts upon preconditioning. These fold changes are shown in green, red, and blue for upregulation, downregulation, and no change, respectively. Glucose-6-phosphate synthesis from lipids involves several steps; therefore, a dashed arrow is used. Highlighted genes are found in the high FCC (panel B). Glc, Glucose; Glc-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; Glc-1-P, glucose-1-phosphate; UDP-Glc, UDP-glucose; Tre-6-P, trehalose-6-phosphate; Tre, trehalose.</p>
