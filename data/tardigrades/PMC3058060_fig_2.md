abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Segmentation is a hallmark of the arthropods; most knowledge about the molecular basis of arthropod segmentation comes from work on the fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this species a hierarchic cascade of segmentation genes subdivides the blastoderm stepwise into single segment wide regions. However, segmentation in the fly is a derived feature since all segments form virtually simultaneously. Conversely, in the vast majority of arthropods the posterior segments form one at a time from a posterior pre-segmental zone. The pair rule genes (PRGs) comprise an important level of the Drosophila segmentation gene cascade and are indeed the first genes that are expressed in typical transverse stripes in the early embryo. Information on expression and function of PRGs outside the insects, however, is scarce. RESULTS: Here we present the expression of the pair rule gene orthologs in the pill millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda: Diplopoda). We find evidence that these genes are involved in segmentation and that components of the hierarchic interaction of the gene network as found in insects may be conserved. We further provide evidence that segments are formed in a single-segment periodicity rather than in pairs of two like in another myriapod, the centipede Strigamia maritima. Finally we show that decoupling of dorsal and ventral segmentation in Glomeris appears already at the level of the PRGs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pair rule gene network is partially conserved among insects and myriapods, some aspects of PRG interaction are, as suggested by expression pattern analysis, convergent, even within the Myriapoda. Conserved expression patterns of PRGs in insects and myriapods, however, may represent ancestral features involved in segmenting the arthropod ancestor.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Expression of *Glomeris even-skipped *and *runt***. Expression of *even-skipped *(**A-D, M**) and *runt *(**E-L, N**). (**A'-D') **show DAPI counter-staining of the embryos shown in (A-D). (**A) **Stage 1 embryo. Segmental stripes in every segment. Bracket marks premandibular and mandibular segments. Asterisk marks stripe of expression in the SAZ. (**B) **Stage 1.1 embryo. Arrow points to fading ventral expression. Note that the expression in the SAZ in (A) (asterisk) is now in the nascent segment anterior to the SAZ (asterisk in (B)) and a new expression domain is forming in the SAZ (filled circle). (**C) **Stage 1.2 embryo. Arrow points to expression in the CNS. Note that the expression domain seen in the SAZ in (B) has developed into a single broad domain (filled circle). (**D) **Stage 2 embryo. Former expression in the SAZ has transformed into a stripe in the nascent segment (filled circle). A new expression domain forms in the SAZ (open circle). (A'-D') DAPI counter-staining of the embryos shown in (A-D). **(E) **Stage 0.4 embryo. Bracket marks premandibular and antennal segments. Expression in the SAZ (asterisk). (**F) **Stage 1 embryo. Arrow points to disappearing ventral expression. Expression seen in the SAZ in A now lies in the nascent segment anterior to the SAZ (asterisk). A new domain of expression has formed in the SAZ (filled circle). Bracket as in (E). (**G) **Stage 1.2 embryo. Arrow points to expression in the CNS. Expression in the SAZ seen in (F) is now in the nascent segment anterior to the SAZ (filled circle). Expression seen in the SAZ in (E) (asterisk) is now one segment anterior to it. A new domain appears in the SAZ (open circle). (**H) **Stage 2 embryo. Arrow as in (G). Expression in the SAZ (open circle) expands. Arrowhead points to strengthened expression in the postmaxillary segment. (**I-L**) Dynamic expression of *runt *in the SAZ in four consecutive developmental stages (that is, stage 3.1 to 3.4). (**M, N) **Concentric expression of *even-skipped *(M) and *runt *(N) around the proctodaeum. In all pictures anterior is to the left. Abbreviations: an, antennae; ic, intercalary (premandibular) segment; md, mandibular segment; oc, ocular field; P, proctodaeum; SAZ, segment addition zone; T, trunk segment.</p>
