abstract: 'While life requires water, many organisms, known as anhydrobiotes, can survive in the absence of water for extended periods of time. Although discovered 300 years ago, we know very little about the fascinating phenomenon of anhydrobiosis. In this paper, we summarize our previous findings on the desiccation tolerance of the Caenorhabditis elegans dauer larva. A special emphasis is given to the role of trehalose in protecting membranes against desiccation. We also propose a simple mechanism for this process.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Figure&nbsp;1.** A simple model of trehalose-mediated membrane protection during desiccation. In the hydrated state, phospholipid head groups interact with water. This interaction keeps the membrane in the liquid crystalline phase. During desiccation in the presence of trehalose, the hydration effect of water is compensated by the presence of sugar, thus preserving the lipid order; therefore, the membrane stays intact upon rehydration. However, without trehalose, desiccation leads to phospholipid packing heterogeneity and reduced acyl chain density, thereby destabilizing the membrane and resulting in damage to the membrane upon influx of water.
