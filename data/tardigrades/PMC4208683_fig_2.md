abstract: "Alteration of regulatory DNA elements or their binding proteins may have drastic consequences for morphological evolution. Chromatin insulators are one example of such proteins and play a fundamental role in organizing gene expression. While a single insulator protein, CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), is known in vertebrates, Drosophila melanogaster utilizes six additional factors. We studied the evolution of these proteins and show here that-in contrast to the bilaterian-wide distribution of CTCF-all other D. melanogaster insulators are restricted to arthropods. The full set is present exclusively in the genus Drosophila whereas only two insulators, Su(Hw) and CTCF, existed at the base of the arthropod clade and all additional factors have been acquired successively at later stages. Secondary loss of factors in some lineages further led to the presence of different insulator subsets in arthropods. Thus, the evolution of insulator proteins within arthropods is an ongoing and dynamic process that reshapes and supplements the ancient CTCF-based system common to bilaterians. Expansion of insulator systems may therefore be a general strategy to increase an organism's gene regulatory repertoire and its potential for morphological plasticity."

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Successive gain of insulator proteins during arthropod evolution. (A) Schematic representation of arthropod relationships (after Regier et al. (<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); Simon et al. (<xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>); Wiegmann et al. (<xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>); Trautwein et al. (<xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>)). Green dots highlight the position of major arthropod groups. The birth (*) and loss (†) of each insulator protein is indicated in red. Several clades/orders are omitted for clarity. Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies) are combined in Palaeoptera. (B) For the taxa shown in A, the number of ESTs and nucleotide sequences deposited at NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>; reference day is May 7, 2012) is indicated as logarithmic bar graph, along with the number of available genome sequences (right column). Sequence data are biased toward holometabolous insects and particular crustacean and chelicerate lineages. Zygentoma have less than 1000 sequences (empty bar graph). (C) Phylogenetic mapping of insulator proteins. Presence of a particular insulator protein is indicated by ⊕, absence by ⊖. Absence is only indicated in orders with sufficient EST and genomic data. Results refer to the BLAST/phylogeny-based strategy and are identical for the HMM/OrthoMCL-based strategy, except some minor modifications (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">S4</xref>).</p>
