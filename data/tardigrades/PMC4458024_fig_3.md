abstract: "BACKGROUND: The tardigrades (water bears) are a cosmopolitan group of microscopic ecdysozoans found in a variety of aquatic and temporarily wet environments. They are members of the Panarthropoda (Tardigrada + Onychophora + Arthropoda), although their exact position within this group remains contested. Studies of embryonic development in tardigrades have been scarce and have yielded contradictory data. Therefore, we investigated the development of the nervous system in embryos of the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini using immunohistochemical techniques in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy in an effort to gain insight into the evolution of the nervous system in panarthropods. RESULTS: An antiserum against acetylated α-tubulin was used to visualize the axonal processes and general neuroanatomy in whole-mount embryos of the eutardigrade H. dujardini. Our data reveal that the tardigrade nervous system develops in an anterior-to-posterior gradient, beginning with the neural structures of the head. The brain develops as a dorsal, bilaterally symmetric structure and contains a single developing central neuropil. The stomodeal nervous system develops separately and includes at least four separate, ring-like commissures. A circumbuccal nerve ring arises late in development and innervates the circumoral sensory field. The segmental trunk ganglia likewise arise from anterior to posterior and establish links with each other via individual pioneering axons. Each hemiganglion is associated with a number of peripheral nerves, including a pair of leg nerves and a branched, dorsolateral nerve. CONCLUSIONS: The revealed pattern of brain development supports a single-segmented brain in tardigrades and challenges previous assignments of homology between tardigrade brain lobes and arthropod brain segments. Likewise, the tardigrade circumbuccal nerve ring cannot be homologized with the arthropod 'circumoral' nerve ring, suggesting that this structure is unique to tardigrades. Finally, we propose that the segmental ganglia of tardigrades and arthropods are homologous and, based on these data, favor a hypothesis that supports tardigrades as the sister group of arthropods."

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Details of neural development in the head region of *Hypsibius dujardini*. Maximum CLSM projections of embryos labeled for acetylated α-tubulin and depth-coded along the anteroposterior (in (A-E); orientation of depth-coding in (A)) or dorsoventral axis (in (F)). Dorsal is up in (A-E); anterior is up in (F). Hollow arrowheads indicate the first neurons of the stomodeal nervous system. Solid arrowheads demarcate stomodeal axons. Arrows point to neurons of the first stomodeal commissure. **(A)** Early-stage embryo showing the first three groups of neural cells. **(B-E)** Series of subsequent embryonic stages. Note that the first stomodeal neurons are posterior to the first brain commissure (=future central brain neuropil) but project axons anteriorly (in (B)). The ventral pair of buccal sensory organs arises before the dorsal pair (in (C), (D)). Also note that the neurons of the first stomodeal commissure are anterior to the brain and central brain neuropil (in (C)). **(E)** Late-stage embryo showing a complete circumbuccal nerve ring. **(F)** Dorsal view of the brain in an embryo of the same developmental stage as in (B). Notice the two pairs of posterodorsal cells (extracerebral neurons *sensu* ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) lying outside the anlage of the brain. Abbreviations: A, anterior; av, anteroventral cells; bo, buccal sensory organs; br, brain cells; c1, central commissure of the first trunk ganglion; cb, developing central brain neuropil (arising from a single commissure); D, dorsal; g1, first trunk ganglion anlage; ic, inner connective; nr, circumbuccal nerve ring; oc, outer connective; P, posterior; pd, posterodorsal cells; V, ventral.
