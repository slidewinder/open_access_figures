abstract: 'Understanding how genes change during evolution to direct the development of diverse body plans is a major goal of the evo-devo field. Achieving this will require the establishment of new model systems that represent key points in phylogeny. These new model systems must be amenable to laboratory culture, and molecular and functional approaches should be feasible. To date, studies of insects have been best represented by the model system Drosophila melanogaster. Given the enormous diversity represented by insect taxa, comparative studies within this clade will provide a wealth of information about the evolutionary potential and trajectories of alternative developmental strategies.Here we established the beetle Dermestes maculatus, a member of the speciose clade Coleoptera, as a new insect model system. We have maintained a continuously breeding culture in the lab and documented Dermestes maculatus embryogenesis using nuclear and phalloidin staining. Anterior segments are specified during the blastoderm stage before gastrulation, and posterior segments are added sequentially during germ band elongation. We isolated and studied the expression and function of the pair-rule segmentation gene paired in Dermestes maculatus. In this species, paired is expressed in stripes during both blastoderm and germ band stages: four primary stripes arise prior to gastrulation, confirming an intermediate-germ mode of development for this species. As in other insects, these primary stripes then split into secondary stripes. To study gene function, we established both embryonic and parental RNAi. Knockdown of Dmac-paired with either method resulted in pair-rule-like segmentation defects, including loss of Engrailed expression in alternate stripes.These studies establish basic approaches necessary to use Dermestes maculatus as a model system. Methods are now available for use of this intermediate-germ insect for future studies of the evolution of regulatory networks controlling insect segmentation, as well as of other processes in development and homeostasis. Consistent with the role of paired in long-germ Drosophila and shorter-germ Tribolium, paired functions as a pair-rule segmentation gene in Dermestes maculatus. Thus, paired retains pair-rule function in insects with different modes of segment addition.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>*Dmac*-*prd* is expressed in stripes during embryogenesis. Expression of *Dmac*-*prd* examined by in situ hybridization. *Arrows* and *arrowheads* indicate primary and secondary stripes, respectively. *Black arrows* show “old” primary stripes while *red arrows* indicate “new” primary stripes. *Black arrowheads* show splitting primary stripes, and *red arrowheads* indicate resolved secondary stripes. **a** A single weak stripe in early blastoderm (*black arrow*). **b** The first stripe becomes clearly detectable (*black arrow*). The second stripe emerges posterior to the first stripe (*red arrow*). **c** Two broad primary stripes appear (*red arrows*). **d** A late blastoderm stage embryo. The first primary stripe remains undivided (*black arrow*). The second primary stripe has divided into two secondary stripes (*red arrowheads*). The third primary stripe is splitting (*black arrowhead*). The fourth primary stripe is showing up *de novo* (*red arrow*). **e** When the broad shallow ventral furrow appears, the first undivided stripe, four secondary stripes (*red arrowheads*) and a fourth primary stripe are detected (*red arrow*). **f** Fading expression is detected in the center of the newly arisen stripe (*black arrowhead*). **g** The fourth primary stripe has divided into two stripes (*red arrowheads*). A weak fifth stripe appears (*red arrow*). **h** During gastrulation, a total of 8 *Dmac*-*prd* stripes are detectable. *Black arrowhead* indicates the posterior end of the ventral furrow. *Red arrow* indicates the posterior-most *Dmac*-*prd* stripe. **i**, **j** As gastrulation proceeds, a 6th primary stripe arises; bilateral head lobes become visible. *Red arrowheads* indicate the dividing stripe. *Red arrow* indicates the newly emerged stripe. *Red dashed line* in **i** shows the anterior edge of the germ rudiment. **k** Embryo during early germ band elongation with striped *Dmac*-*prd* expression across the whole germ band. **l**, **m** Elongating embryo with faint *Dmac*-*prd* stripes in anterior segments. Posterior segments have strong striped *Dmac*-*prd* expression. **n** Embryo at late germ band elongation stage. Stripes have faded except for the most posterior segment (*black arrow*). Hint of *Dmac*-*prd* expression appears in the mandibles (*red arrow*). **o** Later embryo showing *Dmac*-*prd* expression in the head (*black arrows*). **p**–**r** Detailed view of stripe splitting. **p** A total of 7 primary stripes have developed. The first stripe remains undivided. The next 5 primary stripes have resolved to secondary stripes. The 7th primary stripe emerges from the anterior region of the posterior end of the embryo as a broad weak stripe. **q** Anterior striped expression fades. The expression in the center of the 7th stripe becomes fuzzy and faint. **r** The 7th stripe has divided into two thin secondary stripes as there is no expression in the center.
