abstract: " BACKGROUND: During embryonic development of segmented animals, body segments are thought to arise from the so-called \"posterior growth zone\" and the occurrence of this \"zone\" has been used to support the homology of segmentation between arthropods, annelids, and vertebrates. However, the term \"posterior growth zone\" is used ambiguously in the literature, mostly referring to a region of increased proliferation at the posterior end of the embryo. To determine whether such a localised posterior proliferation zone is an ancestral feature of Panarthropoda (Onychophora + Tardigrada + Arthropoda), we examined cell division patterns in embryos of Onychophora. RESULTS: Using in vivo incorporation of the DNA replication marker BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) and anti-phospho-histone H3 immunolabelling, we found that a localised posterior region of proliferating cells does not occur at any developmental stage in onychophoran embryos. This contrasts with a localised pattern of cell divisions at the posterior end of annelid embryos, which we used as a positive control. Based on our data, we present a mathematical model, which challenges the paradigm that a localised posterior proliferation zone is necessary for segment patterning in short germ developing arthropods. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a posterior proliferation zone was absent in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda. By comparing our data from Onychophora with those from annelids, arthropods, and chordates, we suggest that the occurrence of a \"posterior growth zone\" currently cannot be used to support the homology of segmentation between these three animal groups."

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and subsequent immunocytochemical detection in embryos of the onychophoran *Euperipatoides rowelli *(Peripatopsidae)**. Confocal micrographs. Note the intense labelling in the ventral organs and anlagen of the hypocerebral organs, which are derivatives of the anterior-most pair of ventral organs. (A, B) Ventral and lateral views of a late stage 6 embryo after 12 hours incubation in BrdU. Arrows point to the ventral organs. (C) Ventral view of the head of a late stage 6 embryo after 10 hours incubation in BrdU. Double-labelling with the DNA-selective dye Hoechst (Bisbenzimide, blue) and anti-BrdU antibody (green). (D) Detail of two pairs of ventral organs from a stage 6 embryo after 12 hours incubation in BrdU. (E) Optical cross-section of an anlage of the hypocerebral organ after 12 hours incubation in BrdU showing a superficial layer of anti-BrdU labelled cells. (F) Detail of ventral organ nuclei after 3 hours incubation in BrdU (ventral view). Double-labelling with anti-BrdU (green) and anti-phospho-histone H3 antibodies (α-PH3, red). Arrowheads point to BrdU incorporation foci in each nucleus. Abbreviations: br, presumptive brain tissue; ho, anlagen of hypocerebral organs; mo, presumptive mouth opening; vo, ventral organs. Scale bars: A and B, 500 μm; C, 100 μm; D, 50 μm; E and F, 20 μm.</p>
