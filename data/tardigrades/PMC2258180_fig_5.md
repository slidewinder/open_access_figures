abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Systematic comparisons between genomic sequence datasets have revealed a wide spectrum of sequence specificity from sequences that are highly conserved to those that are specific to individual species. Due to the limited number of fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes, analyses of this spectrum have largely focused on prokaryotes. Combining existing genomic datasets with the partial genomes of 193 eukaryotes derived from collections of expressed sequence tags, we performed a quantitative analysis of the sequence specificity spectrum to provide a global view of the origins and extent of sequence diversity across the three domains of life. RESULTS: Comparisons with prokaryotic datasets reveal a greater genetic diversity within eukaryotes that may be related to differences in modes of genetic inheritance. Mapping this diversity within a phylogenetic framework revealed that the majority of sequences are either highly conserved or specific to the species or taxon from which they derive. Between these two extremes, several evolutionary landmarks consisting of large numbers of sequences conserved within specific taxonomic groups were identified. For example, 8% of sequences derived from metazoan species are specific and conserved within the metazoan lineage. Many of these sequences likely mediate metazoan specific functions, such as cell-cell communication and differentiation. CONCLUSION: Through the use of partial genome datasets, this study provides a unique perspective of sequence conservation across the three domains of life. The provision of taxon restricted sequences should prove valuable for future computational and biochemical analyses aimed at understanding evolutionary and functional relationships.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Taxonomic distribution of sequences from eukaryotic partial genomes. As for Figure 4a, this graphic presents the distribution of partial genome sequences associated with 20 eukaryotic taxa. For each taxon, the three numbers in boxes represent: number of species in group (white numerals on black background); percentage of sequences that are species-specific (that is, do not share any sequence similarity with any other species; black numerals on white background); percentage of sequences that are group specific (that is, share sequence similarity only with one or more sequences from a species in the same taxon (light gray background). The numbers of sequences in each group are given in blue (orange for deuterostomes). Numbers in dark gray boxes indicate the percentage of sequences from each group that have sequence similarity to a gene from the corresponding group. Note that this figure does not attempt to resolve the root of eukaryotes but, as for Figure 4a, has a triangular graphic to represent connections between the three major taxonomic groups - protists, plants and fungi/metazoa. Similarly, as for Figure 4a, this graphic does not provide explicit information on relative times of divergence and care must be taken in comparing numbers between different branches. For example, one study based on molecular clock analysis has estimated the time of divergence of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes to range from 850 to 1,100 Mya, similar to that of protostomes and deuterostomes (880-1,080 Mya) [37]. In this figure, the former might appear to be a relatively recent split while the latter (due to its more basal position within the tree) might appear to be more ancient.</p>
