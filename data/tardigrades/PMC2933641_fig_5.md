abstract: ' BACKGROUND: The composition of the arthropod head is one of the most contentious issues in animal evolution. In particular, controversy surrounds the homology and innervation of segmental cephalic appendages by the brain. Onychophora (velvet worms) play a crucial role in understanding the evolution of the arthropod brain, because they are close relatives of arthropods and have apparently changed little since the Early Cambrian. However, the segmental origins of their brain neuropils and the number of cephalic appendages innervated by the brain--key issues in clarifying brain composition in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda--remain unclear. RESULTS: Using immunolabelling and neuronal tracing techniques in the developing and adult onychophoran brain, we found that the major brain neuropils arise from only the anterior-most body segment, and that two pairs of segmental appendages are innervated by the brain. The region of the central nervous system corresponding to the arthropod tritocerebrum is not differentiated as part of the onychophoran brain but instead belongs to the ventral nerve cords. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contradict the assumptions of a tripartite (three-segmented) brain in Onychophora and instead confirm the hypothesis of bipartite (two-segmented) brain composition. They suggest that the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda possessed a brain consisting of protocerebrum and deutocerebrum whereas the tritocerebrum evolved in arthropods.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Position of neuronal cell bodies innervating segmental cephalic appendages in Onychophora and posterior border of the onychophoran brain**. (A) Overview of the differential staining of segmental cephalic nerves in *Euperipatoides rowelli *by retrograde fills with dextran (confocal projection). Jaw nerves (jn) and slime papilla nerves (sn) from both sides of the body were filled with dextran-tetramethylrhodamine (red) and dextran-fluorescein (green). Anterior is up. Scale bar: 200 μm. (B) Diagram summarising the location of neuronal cell bodies innervating the antennae (yellow), jaws (red), and slime papillae (green). Note that the cell bodies of neurons innervating the slime papillae lie outside the brain. (C) Anterior portion of the onychophoran nervous system (reconstruction based on confocal images of an immunolabelled embryo; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Figure S1). The position of neurons innervating the segmental cephalic appendages (colour coding as in B) is mapped on the reconstructed nervous system. Blue dashed line indicates the posterior brain border behind the cerebral accumulation of neurons. Abbreviations: an, antennal nerve; br, cerebral ganglion or brain; cn, central neuropil; dc, deutocerebrum; ho, hypocerebral organ; jn, jaw nerve; ln, leg nerves; nc, nerve cord; pc, protocerebrum; sn, slime papilla nerves.</p>
