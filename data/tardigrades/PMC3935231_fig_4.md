abstract: 'As one of the closest relatives of arthropods, Onychophora plays an important role in understanding the evolution of arthropod body plans. Currently there is controversy surrounding the evolution of the brain among the ecdysozoan clades, which shows a collar-shaped, circumoral organization in cycloneuralians but a ganglionic architecture in panarthropods. Based on the innervation pattern of lip papillae surrounding the mouth, the onychophoran brain has been interpreted as a circumoral ring, suggesting that this organization is an ancestral feature of Ecdysozoa. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with other published data. To explore the evolutionary origin of the onychophoran mouth and to shed light on the evolution of the ecdysozoan brains, we analyzed the innervation pattern and morphogenesis of the oral lip papillae in the onychophoran Euperipatoides rowelli using DNA labeling, immunocytochemistry, and neuronal tracing techniques. Our morphogenetic data revealed that the seven paired and one unpaired oral lip papillae arise from three anterior-most body segments. Retrograde fills show that only the first and the third nerves supplying the lip papillae are associated with cell bodies within the brain, whereas the second nerve exclusively receives fibers from somata of peripheral neurons located in the lip papillae. According to our anterograde fills and immunocytochemical data, the first nerve supplies the anterior-most pair of lip papillae, whereas the second and the third nerves are associated with the second to fifth and second to eighth lip papillae, respectively. These data suggest that the lip papillae of E. rowelli are mainly innervated by the proto- and deutocerebrum, whereas there are only a few additional cell bodies situated posterior to the brain. According to these findings, the overall innervation pattern of the oral lip papillae in E. rowelli is incompatible with the interpretation of the onychophoran brain as a modified circumoral ring.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Morphogenesis of lip papillae encompassing the definitive mouth opening in *Euperipatoides rowelli*. (A–L)** Confocal micrographs of embryonic heads at successive developmental stages in ventrolateral and ventral views. DNA labeling with Bisbenzimide. Developing lip papillae are highlighted by artificial colors. Note that the first pair of lip papillae (number 1 in **L** and red in **F–L**) is associated with the first body segment and that it moves from an anterior to a ventral position during development. Note also that the remaining pairs of lip papillae (numbers 2–7 in **L**) arise lateral to the anlagen of jaws, i.e., in the second body segment, whereas the posterior-most papilla (number 8 in **L**) originates from a paired anlage in the third body segment (magenta in **J–L**). Arrowheads in **(E–K)** point to the developing lip sensilla. Abbreviations: as, anlage of the antennal segment (=cephalic lobe); at, presumptive antenna; dm, definitive mouth opening; ey, eye anlage; ho, anlagen of the hypocerebral organs; jw, developing jaw; le, anlage of the first walking leg; po, embryonic preventral organ of the slime papilla segment; so, openings of the developing salivary glands; sp, developing slime papilla; st, stomodeum; to, embryonic tongue; ve, ventral extraembryonic tissue; vo, developing ventral organ of the slime papilla segment. Scale bars: 250 μm **(A–L)**.</p>
