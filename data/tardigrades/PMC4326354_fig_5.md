abstract: 'Tardigrades are able to tolerate almost complete dehydration through transition to a metabolically inactive state, called "anhydrobiosis". Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins are heat-soluble proteins involved in the desiccation tolerance of many anhydrobiotic organisms. Tardigrades, Ramazzottius varieornatus, however, express predominantly tardigrade-unique heat-soluble proteins: CAHS (Cytoplasmic Abundant Heat Soluble) and SAHS (Secretory Abundant Heat Soluble) proteins, which are secreted or localized in most intracellular compartments, except the mitochondria. Although mitochondrial integrity is crucial to ensure cellular survival, protective molecules for mitochondria have remained elusive. Here, we identified two novel mitochondrial heat-soluble proteins, RvLEAM and MAHS (Mitochondrial Abundant Heat Soluble), as potent mitochondrial protectants from Ramazzottius varieornatus. RvLEAM is a group3 LEA protein and immunohistochemistry confirmed its mitochondrial localization in tardigrade cells. MAHS-green fluorescent protein fusion protein localized in human mitochondria and was heat-soluble in vitro, though no sequence similarity with other known proteins was found, and one region was conserved among tardigrades. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RvLEAM protein as well as MAHS protein improved the hyperosmotic tolerance of human cells. The findings of the present study revealed that tardigrade mitochondria contain at least two types of heat-soluble proteins that might have protective roles in water-deficient environments.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Effects of RvLEAM and MAHS proteins on metabolic activity of human cells under hyperosmotic stress.</title> Human HEp-2 cells (black), and HEp-2 cells expressing RvLEAM (light grey) or MAHS (dark grey) were exposed to medium supplemented with defined concentrations of sucrose for 48 h. After replacement of the medium with serum-free isotonic medium, cell metabolic activities were analysed using PrestoBlue reagents. Metabolic activities at each sucrose concentration are shown as a percentage of the mean activity observed in the cells at 0 mM sucrose (n = 3, ±SEM). Statistical significance against untransfected HEp-2 cells was determined by *Dunnett*’s test (*, *P*&lt;0.05; **, *P*&lt;0.01). *P*-values are shown above asterisks where statistically significant.</p>
