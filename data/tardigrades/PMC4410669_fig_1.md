abstract: 'Knowledge on neuropeptide receptor systems is integral to understanding animal physiology. Yet, obtaining general insight into neuropeptide signalling in a clade as biodiverse as the insects is problematic. Here we apply fluorescent analogues of three key insect neuropeptides to map renal tissue architecture across systematically chosen representatives of the major insect Orders, to provide an unprecedented overview of insect renal function and control. In endopterygote insects, such as Drosophila, two distinct transporting cell types receive separate neuropeptide signals, whereas in the ancestral exopterygotes, a single, general cell type mediates all signals. Intriguingly, the largest insect Order Coleoptera (beetles) has evolved a unique approach, in which only a small fraction of cells are targets for neuropeptide action. In addition to demonstrating a universal utility of this technology, our results reveal not only a generality of signalling by the evolutionarily ancient neuropeptide families but also a clear functional separation of the types of cells that mediate the signal.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Mechanism and control of the *Drosophila* renal (Malpighian) tubule and principle of *ex vivo* receptor binding assay.</title> (**a**) Spatial organization of the *Drosophila* tubule as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy, with superimposed illustrations of principal and secondary cells. Scale bar, 100 μm. (**b**) Classic two-cell-type model: fluid transport is energized by a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase) located in the apical membrane of PCs (grey), which through a K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger, drives net secretion of K<sup>+</sup> into the lumen. Whereas basal levels of chloride flux take place through para- and/or trans cellular mechanisms (green arrows), kinin-stimulated rates of chloride transport are mediated by chloride channels in SCs (red)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The chloride movement balances the net charge transfer, with osmotically obliged water (blue arrows) following through water channels in SCs and/or through paracellular routes. The DKR localizes uniquely to SCs, and controls, through stimulation with DK and subsequent intracellular calcium release, the chloride shunt conductance and thereby fluid transport. (**c**) A high quantum yield fluorophore (Bodipy TMR-C<sub>5</sub>-maleimide) is conjugated to the N-terminal region (non-functional end) via a cysteine linker to a synthetic analogue of the native neuropeptide (DK), hereby generating a fluorescently tagged neuropeptide (DK-F). The fluorescently tagged neuropeptide is applied to acutely dissected tissue (for example, MTs), where the labelled peptide binds to the endogenous receptor (DKR), hereby allowing direct visualization of neuropeptide-receptor interaction and subsequent identification of the cells that receive the neuroendocrine signal.
