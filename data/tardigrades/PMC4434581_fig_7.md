abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The digestive systems of animals can become highly specialized in response to their exploration and occupation of new ecological niches. Although studies on different animals have revealed commonalities in gut formation, the model systems Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, which belong to the invertebrate group Ecdysozoa, exhibit remarkable deviations in how their intestines develop. Their morphological and developmental idiosyncrasies have hindered reconstructions of ancestral gut characters for the Ecdysozoa, and limit comparisons with vertebrate models. In this respect, the phylogenetic position, and slow evolving morphological and molecular characters of marine priapulid worms advance them as a key group to decipher evolutionary events that occurred in the lineages leading to C. elegans and D. melanogaster. RESULTS: In the priapulid Priapulus caudatus, the gut consists of an ectodermal foregut and anus, and a mid region of at least partial endodermal origin. The inner gut develops into a 16-cell primordium devoid of visceral musculature, arranged in three mid tetrads and two posterior duplets. The mouth invaginates ventrally and shifts to a terminal anterior position as the ventral anterior ectoderm differentially proliferates. Contraction of the musculature occurs as the head region retracts into the trunk and resolves the definitive larval body plan. Despite obvious developmental differences with C. elegans and D. melanogaster, the expression in P. caudatus of the gut-related candidate genes NK2.1, foxQ2, FGF8/17/18, GATA456, HNF4, wnt1, and evx demonstrate three distinct evolutionarily conserved molecular profiles that correlate with morphologically identified sub-regions of the gut. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative analysis of priapulid development suggests that a midgut formed by a single endodermal population of vegetal cells, a ventral mouth, and the blastoporal origin of the anus are ancestral features in the Ecdysozoa. Our molecular data on P. caudatus reveal a conserved ecdysozoan gut-patterning program and demonstrates that extreme morphological divergence has not been accompanied by major molecular innovations in transcriptional regulators during digestive system evolution in the Ecdysozoa. Our data help us understand the origins of the ecdysozoan body plan, including those of C. elegans and D. melanogaster, and this is critical for comparisons between these two prominent model systems and their vertebrate counterparts.'

### Figure 7
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The evolution of the position of the mouth in the Ecdysozoa. **(A)** Diversity of mouth position in embryos and adults of the different ecdysozoan lineages. While in the Spiralia the mouth forms ventrally, and stays ventral in the adult, this situation is more variable in the Ecdysozoa. The mouth can form ventrally (priapulids, some nematodes, onychophorans, and most arthropods), at an anterior terminal position (most nematodes, nematomorphs, and tardigrades), or even on the dorsal site (in the pycnogonid arthropods). However, in the adults the mouth occupies an anterior terminal position, except in extant onychophorans and most arthropods (pycnogonids have a terminal mouth). While an anterior terminal mouth in the adult seems to be ancestral for the Ecdysozoa, the original embryonic position has been debated. **(B)** Evolutionary scenario of an ancestral ventral embryonic mouth. In this situation, independent modifications occurred in the Nematoida and Tardigrada that led to the late formation of the mouth at a terminal position. **(C)** Evolutionary scenario of an ancestral anterior embryonic mouth. In this situation, the embryonic mouth shifted to an anterior position at the base of the Ecdysozoa, and was secondarily reverted to a ventral site in priapulids and pan-arthropods, which is less parsimonious than assuming an ancestral ventral embryonic mouth (see **B**). For the sake of clarity, the ventral mouth of certain nematodes and the dorsal mouth of pycnogonids have not been considered in **B** or **C**. In **A**-**C**, the asterisk indicates the alternative branching of the Scalidophora (Priapulida, Kinorhyncha, Loricifera) together with the Nematoida to form what has been proposed as the Cycloneuralia clade.
