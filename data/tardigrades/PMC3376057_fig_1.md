abstract: "Henningsmoenicaris scutula (Walossek and Müller, 1990) (Fig.\_1) is a tiny representative of Crustacea, systematically standing close to the stemline. It is found in stinkstone ('Orsten') nodules from the Alum Shale, where a rich fauna of small organisms is excellently preserved. Three dimensional morphology is retained by phosphatisation, which exhibits the finest details, such as cuticular structures, fine appendages and especially the morphology of the compound eyes. The stalked eyes of H. scutula investigated here were equipped with a differentiated visual surface with four different areas of vision. The most intriguing is a field of view oriented laterally to the contralateral side of each eye, so that the fields of view of both compound eyes intersect, and give information about any object moving within the vicinity. Due to this, although, for various reasons this compound eye probably was not able to form a proper image, it was able to perceive tiny prey within a wide visual field, in the same way that the movement of figures can be traced in a chess game. This can be considered as a highly sophisticated visual system that developed early in the history of reported eye evolution, as this compound eye is almost exactly half a billion years old."

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Figure&nbsp;1.** Types of Cambrian Eyes and the functioning of the eye of *Henningsmoenicaris scutula* (Waklossek and Müller, 1990).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><sup>6</sup></xref> (A1) Schematic drawing of *Isoxys auritus* Jiang, 1982, a pelagic arthropod from the oldest fossil record of arthropods (Chengjiang Lagerstätte, Lower Cambrian, Yunnan, China). Note the stalked eyes protruding from the carapace, and covered by a cuticularian top, the palpebral lobe. (A2) Indvidual eye of *I. auritus*, seen from above. Note the palpebral lobe and the visual surface pressed out sidewards when being embedded. (A3) Spherical visual units visible at the margin of the palpebral lobe, seen from above, indicated by the arrow.

(B3) Distinct visual areas of *H. scutula* within one eye, defined by intersections (‘focal points’) of the optical axes of the ommatidia. The numbers indicate the opening angles of the ommatidia in longitudinal projection. (B3) visual field of *H. scutula*. Note the intersections of the optical axes of the ommatidia (black lines) which intersect in the front of the organism and far to the sides. The dark gray area indicates the ‘blind’, which subtends the shape of the body of the organism. (B5) Any moving particle can be traced in the coordinates by facets of both eyes like a figure in a chess game.</p>
