abstract: 'Knowledge on neuropeptide receptor systems is integral to understanding animal physiology. Yet, obtaining general insight into neuropeptide signalling in a clade as biodiverse as the insects is problematic. Here we apply fluorescent analogues of three key insect neuropeptides to map renal tissue architecture across systematically chosen representatives of the major insect Orders, to provide an unprecedented overview of insect renal function and control. In endopterygote insects, such as Drosophila, two distinct transporting cell types receive separate neuropeptide signals, whereas in the ancestral exopterygotes, a single, general cell type mediates all signals. Intriguingly, the largest insect Order Coleoptera (beetles) has evolved a unique approach, in which only a small fraction of cells are targets for neuropeptide action. In addition to demonstrating a universal utility of this technology, our results reveal not only a generality of signalling by the evolutionarily ancient neuropeptide families but also a clear functional separation of the types of cells that mediate the signal.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Phylogenetic distribution of the two-cell-type model for insect renal function.</title> Consensus insect phylogeny of the insect species used in our study with superimposed character matrix. A full green circle denotes a positive, while a full red circle indicates a negative, for each category for each species. By contrast, a half green or red circle indicates that, for at least one member of that insect group, a positive or negative has been experimentally confirmed. A grey circle implies that data is not available. A coloured triangle indicates a key event in the evolution of insect renal function and control: Green triangle, SCs arose; blue triangle, SCs adopted kinin signalling; purple triangle, kinin-signalling secondary lost. The phylogenetic relationships and error bars reflecting 95% confidence intervals of the estimated divergence times for the branching nodes were adopted from refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>.</p>
