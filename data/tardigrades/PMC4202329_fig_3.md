abstract: 'Screening of a deeply sequenced transcriptome using Illumina sequencing as well as the genome of the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini revealed a set of five opsin genes. To clarify the phylogenetic position of these genes and to elucidate the evolutionary history of opsins in Panarthropoda (Onychophora + Tardigrada + Arthropoda), we reconstructed the phylogeny of broadly sampled metazoan opsin genes using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods in conjunction with carefully selected substitution models. According to our findings, the opsin repertoire of H. dujardini comprises representatives of all three major bilaterian opsin clades, including one r-opsin, three c-opsins, and a Group 4 opsin (neuropsin/opsin-5). The identification of the tardigrade ortholog of neuropsin/opsin-5 is the first record of this opsin type in a protostome, but our screening of available metazoan genomes revealed that it is also present in other protostomes. Our opsin phylogeny further suggests that two r-opsins, including an "arthropsin," were present in the last common ancestor of Panarthropoda. Although both r-opsin lineages were retained in Onychophora and Arthropoda, the arthropsin was lost in Tardigrada. The single (most likely visual) r-opsin found in H. dujardini supports the hypothesis of monochromatic vision in the panarthropod ancestor, whereas two duplications of the ancestral panarthropod c-opsin have led to three c-opsins in tardigrades. Although the early-branching nodes are unstable within the metazoans, our findings suggest that the last common ancestor of Bilateria possessed six opsins: Two r-opsins, one c-opsin, and three Group 4 opsins, one of which (Go opsin) was lost in the ecdysozoan lineage.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Hypotheses on the evolutionary history of opsin genes in Panarthropoda and Bilateria based on our phylogenetic analyses of metazoan opsin sequences. (*A*) Scenario on opsin evolution in Panarthropoda. The trichotomy is due to the uncertain position of Tardigrada as the sister group of Arthropoda, Onychophora, or Onychophora plus Arthropoda (see <xref rid="evu193-B41" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al. 2013</xref> and references therein). According to this scenario, the last common ancestor of Panarthropoda possessed five opsin genes: One c-opsin, two r-opsins, and two Group 4 opsins. The three c-opsin genes of *H. dujardini* might have evolved by gene duplications either in the tardigrade lineage, or a tardigrade subgroup. (*B*) Scenario on opsin evolution in Bilateria, according to which the last common bilaterian ancestor possessed six opsin genes. Although the arthropsin and melanopsin/[visual] r-opsin lineages arose by a duplication of the r-opsin precursor, two additional duplications in the bilaterian Group 4 opsin clade gave rise to the neuropsin/opsin-5, peropsin, and Go-opsin lineages. Note that the Go-opsin gene was subsequently lost in the last common ancestor of Ecdysozoa.</p>
