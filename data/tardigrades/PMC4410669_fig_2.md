abstract: 'Knowledge on neuropeptide receptor systems is integral to understanding animal physiology. Yet, obtaining general insight into neuropeptide signalling in a clade as biodiverse as the insects is problematic. Here we apply fluorescent analogues of three key insect neuropeptides to map renal tissue architecture across systematically chosen representatives of the major insect Orders, to provide an unprecedented overview of insect renal function and control. In endopterygote insects, such as Drosophila, two distinct transporting cell types receive separate neuropeptide signals, whereas in the ancestral exopterygotes, a single, general cell type mediates all signals. Intriguingly, the largest insect Order Coleoptera (beetles) has evolved a unique approach, in which only a small fraction of cells are targets for neuropeptide action. In addition to demonstrating a universal utility of this technology, our results reveal not only a generality of signalling by the evolutionarily ancient neuropeptide families but also a clear functional separation of the types of cells that mediate the signal.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Fluorophore-labelled *Drosophila* kinin reports receptor localization in renal (Malpighian) tubules of *Drosophila*.</title> (**a**) Application of DK-F (10<sup>−7</sup> M) to tubules in which SCs are marked by DKR-GFP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> confirmed that the peptide co-localizes with DKRs on SCs. (**b**) Competitive inhibition with DK (10<sup>−5</sup> M) almost fully abolished the fluorescent signal. (**a**,**b**) Maximum projections of confocal z-series. Scale bar, 25 μm. (**c**) Kinetic inhibition significantly reduced (**P*&lt;0.05, unpaired, two-sample *t*-test) the fluorescent intensity in SCs. The average intensity profile±s.e.m. of *n*=22 SCs from DK-F treatments showed a distinct peak for the basolateral membrane of SCs, which was not present in the average intensity profile±s.e.m. of *n*=19 SCs from+DK treatments. Arrows exemplify the x-y position of intensity traces made through optical sections (thickness: 10 μm) of individual SCs, as identified by smaller nuclei (stippled circle). (**d**) Time-lapse sequence of an individual SC from wild-type (Canton S) tubules following application of DK-F (10<sup>−7</sup> M). Kinin binding can be visualized almost immediately, but increases in intensity over time as the receptor population becomes saturated and the peptide becomes internalized. Putative receptor ‘hotspots' are visible as punctae. Images are grey scaled and inverse coloured to increase signal clarity. Scale bar, 25 μm. (**e**) DK-F and DK stimulated calcium release following peptide application, indicates that the biological activity of DK is unaffected by fluorophore labelling, as evidenced by a very similar biphasic response. Black arrows indicate time of injection with either Schneider's medium (mock) or peptide (ligand). The traces shown are representative of *n*=3 separate experiments. (**f**) DK-F and DK significantly stimulate (**P*&lt;0.05, paired-samples *t*-test) fluid secretion rates compared with basal conditions in MTs (*n*=6–7) of *Drosophila*. Black arrow indicates time of peptide application. Values are expressed as mean±s.e.m.</p>
