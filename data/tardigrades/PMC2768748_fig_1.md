abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Tardigrades represent an animal phylum with extraordinary resistance to environmental stress. RESULTS: To gain insights into their stress-specific adaptation potential, major clusters of related and similar proteins are identified, as well as specific functional clusters delineated comparing all tardigrades and individual species (Milnesium tardigradum, Hypsibius dujardini, Echiniscus testudo, Tulinus stephaniae, Richtersius coronifer) and functional elements in tardigrade mRNAs are analysed. We find that 39.3% of the total sequences clustered in 58 clusters of more than 20 proteins. Among these are ten tardigrade specific as well as a number of stress-specific protein clusters. Tardigrade-specific functional adaptations include strong protein, DNA- and redox protection, maintenance and protein recycling. Specific regulatory elements regulate tardigrade mRNA stability such as lox P DICE elements whereas 14 other RNA elements of higher eukaryotes are not found. Further features of tardigrade specific adaption are rapidly identified by sequence and/or pattern search on the web-tool tardigrade analyzer http://waterbear.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de. The work-bench offers nucleotide pattern analysis for promotor and regulatory element detection (tardigrade specific; nrdb) as well as rapid COG search for function assignments including species-specific repositories of all analysed data. CONCLUSION: Different protein clusters and regulatory elements implicated in tardigrade stress adaptations are analysed including unpublished tardigrade sequences.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Functional clusters by CLANS of sequence related proteins in tardigrades**. All available [see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S5] tardigrade protein sequences were clustered in a 3D sphere according to their sequence distance and were projected to the paper plane. Individual protein functions are colored [for color code see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1] and all listed in Table 1. Functional clusters appear as patches of an individual color. Color code and clusters can be interactively examined at the Tardigrade workbench <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://waterbear.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de">http://waterbear.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de</ext-link> and are given in [additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table S1]. figure1.pdf</p>
