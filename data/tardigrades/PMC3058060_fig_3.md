abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Segmentation is a hallmark of the arthropods; most knowledge about the molecular basis of arthropod segmentation comes from work on the fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this species a hierarchic cascade of segmentation genes subdivides the blastoderm stepwise into single segment wide regions. However, segmentation in the fly is a derived feature since all segments form virtually simultaneously. Conversely, in the vast majority of arthropods the posterior segments form one at a time from a posterior pre-segmental zone. The pair rule genes (PRGs) comprise an important level of the Drosophila segmentation gene cascade and are indeed the first genes that are expressed in typical transverse stripes in the early embryo. Information on expression and function of PRGs outside the insects, however, is scarce. RESULTS: Here we present the expression of the pair rule gene orthologs in the pill millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda: Diplopoda). We find evidence that these genes are involved in segmentation and that components of the hierarchic interaction of the gene network as found in insects may be conserved. We further provide evidence that segments are formed in a single-segment periodicity rather than in pairs of two like in another myriapod, the centipede Strigamia maritima. Finally we show that decoupling of dorsal and ventral segmentation in Glomeris appears already at the level of the PRGs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pair rule gene network is partially conserved among insects and myriapods, some aspects of PRG interaction are, as suggested by expression pattern analysis, convergent, even within the Myriapoda. Conserved expression patterns of PRGs in insects and myriapods, however, may represent ancestral features involved in segmenting the arthropod ancestor.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Double staining of *Glomeris *PRGs (purple) with *engrailed *(red)**. Pictures denoted in capital letters are whole mounts; pictures denoted in small letters show close-ups. All embryos are flat-mounted; yolk removed. (**A, B) ***engrailed *(*en*) is expressed anterior adjacent to *even-skipped *(*eve*). Arrow in (B) points to dot-like expression in the CNS. (**C, D) ***en *is expressed anterior adjacent to *runt (run)*. Asterisks in (D) denote enhanced dorsal expression in the postmaxillary segment. (**E, F) ***en *is expressed posteriorly adjacent to *opa*. The arrows mark *opa *expression at the position where the premandibular and postmaxillary appendages should form, but are repressed by unknown mechanisms. (**G, H) ***en *is expressed posterior to *sloppy-paired *(*slp*) at the anterior edge of the SAZ. (**I, J) ***en *is expressed posterior to and partially overlapping with *pairberry-1 *(*pby-1*) in nascent segments. Abbreviations: md, mandibular segment; SAZ, segment addition zone; st, stage; T, trunk segment.</p>
