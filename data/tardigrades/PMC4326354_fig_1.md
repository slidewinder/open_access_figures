abstract: 'Tardigrades are able to tolerate almost complete dehydration through transition to a metabolically inactive state, called "anhydrobiosis". Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins are heat-soluble proteins involved in the desiccation tolerance of many anhydrobiotic organisms. Tardigrades, Ramazzottius varieornatus, however, express predominantly tardigrade-unique heat-soluble proteins: CAHS (Cytoplasmic Abundant Heat Soluble) and SAHS (Secretory Abundant Heat Soluble) proteins, which are secreted or localized in most intracellular compartments, except the mitochondria. Although mitochondrial integrity is crucial to ensure cellular survival, protective molecules for mitochondria have remained elusive. Here, we identified two novel mitochondrial heat-soluble proteins, RvLEAM and MAHS (Mitochondrial Abundant Heat Soluble), as potent mitochondrial protectants from Ramazzottius varieornatus. RvLEAM is a group3 LEA protein and immunohistochemistry confirmed its mitochondrial localization in tardigrade cells. MAHS-green fluorescent protein fusion protein localized in human mitochondria and was heat-soluble in vitro, though no sequence similarity with other known proteins was found, and one region was conserved among tardigrades. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RvLEAM protein as well as MAHS protein improved the hyperosmotic tolerance of human cells. The findings of the present study revealed that tardigrade mitochondria contain at least two types of heat-soluble proteins that might have protective roles in water-deficient environments.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Protein structure and mitochondria-targeting potential of RvLEAM.</title> (a) Schematic representation of RvLEAM protein structure with hydropathy plot. Pink box indicates Mitochondria Targeting Peptide (MTP) at the N-terminus and the nine green boxes indicate LEA motifs found in RvLEAM protein. The six yellow bars in the hydropathy plot indicate predicted helix regions (H1–6) (b) Alignment of LEA motif sequences of RvLEAM with consensus. Greek characters in the consensus sequence indicate the following: Ψ, basic residue; Ω, acidic or amide residue; Φ, aliphatic residue; X, non-conserved residue. Residues consistent with the consensus are highlighted in deep green, and amino acids at non-conserved positions are shown in light green. Sequence logo created from nine LEA motifs of RvLEAM is shown below the alignment. (c) Amphipathic distribution of amino acids in predicted helical region of repeating LEA motifs 3 and 4. Amino acids are indicated as hydrophilic (pink), negatively-charged (red), positively-charged (blue), and hydrophobic (yellow) residues. (d) Subcellular localization of RvLEAM-GFP fusion protein (top) and GFP alone (bottom) in human HEp-2 cells. GFP signals (left). Mitochondria stained with Mito-Tracker (centre).
