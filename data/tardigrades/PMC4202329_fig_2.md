abstract: 'Screening of a deeply sequenced transcriptome using Illumina sequencing as well as the genome of the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini revealed a set of five opsin genes. To clarify the phylogenetic position of these genes and to elucidate the evolutionary history of opsins in Panarthropoda (Onychophora + Tardigrada + Arthropoda), we reconstructed the phylogeny of broadly sampled metazoan opsin genes using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods in conjunction with carefully selected substitution models. According to our findings, the opsin repertoire of H. dujardini comprises representatives of all three major bilaterian opsin clades, including one r-opsin, three c-opsins, and a Group 4 opsin (neuropsin/opsin-5). The identification of the tardigrade ortholog of neuropsin/opsin-5 is the first record of this opsin type in a protostome, but our screening of available metazoan genomes revealed that it is also present in other protostomes. Our opsin phylogeny further suggests that two r-opsins, including an "arthropsin," were present in the last common ancestor of Panarthropoda. Although both r-opsin lineages were retained in Onychophora and Arthropoda, the arthropsin was lost in Tardigrada. The single (most likely visual) r-opsin found in H. dujardini supports the hypothesis of monochromatic vision in the panarthropod ancestor, whereas two duplications of the ancestral panarthropod c-opsin have led to three c-opsins in tardigrades. Although the early-branching nodes are unstable within the metazoans, our findings suggest that the last common ancestor of Bilateria possessed six opsins: Two r-opsins, one c-opsin, and three Group 4 opsins, one of which (Go opsin) was lost in the ecdysozoan lineage.'

(*A*) Detail view of the bilaterian r-opsin clade, in which *Hd-r-opsin* of *H. dujardini* occurs as the sister group to the onychophoran *onychopsin* clade. (*B*) Detail view of the neuropsin/opsin-5 subgroup of Group 4 opsins, illustrating the placement of *Hd-neuropsin* of *H. dujardini* among the neuropsins from other protostomes. (*C*) Detail view of the bilaterian c-opsin clade, in which *Hd-c-opsin1*, *Hd-c-opsin2* and *Hd-c-opsin3* of *H. dujardini* are nested as a monophyletic group within the panarthropod c-opsin clade containing the arthropod pteropsins.</p>
