abstract: ' BACKGROUND: The composition of the arthropod head is one of the most contentious issues in animal evolution. In particular, controversy surrounds the homology and innervation of segmental cephalic appendages by the brain. Onychophora (velvet worms) play a crucial role in understanding the evolution of the arthropod brain, because they are close relatives of arthropods and have apparently changed little since the Early Cambrian. However, the segmental origins of their brain neuropils and the number of cephalic appendages innervated by the brain--key issues in clarifying brain composition in the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda--remain unclear. RESULTS: Using immunolabelling and neuronal tracing techniques in the developing and adult onychophoran brain, we found that the major brain neuropils arise from only the anterior-most body segment, and that two pairs of segmental appendages are innervated by the brain. The region of the central nervous system corresponding to the arthropod tritocerebrum is not differentiated as part of the onychophoran brain but instead belongs to the ventral nerve cords. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contradict the assumptions of a tripartite (three-segmented) brain in Onychophora and instead confirm the hypothesis of bipartite (two-segmented) brain composition. They suggest that the last common ancestor of Onychophora and Arthropoda possessed a brain consisting of protocerebrum and deutocerebrum whereas the tritocerebrum evolved in arthropods.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Head composition and homology of cephalic appendages in Onychophora and Arthropoda**. (A) Ventral view of onychophoran "head" showing three pairs of modified appendages: antennae (at), jaws (jw), and slime papillae (sp). Scanning electron micrograph. Scale bar: 500 μm. (B) Diagram of expression pattern of segment polarity gene *engrailed *in an onychophoran embryo in lateral view (based on fig. 1a from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). Scale bar: 200 μm. Note that there are only three anterior expression domains corresponding to posterior borders of antennal (as), jaw (js), and slime papilla segments (ss), in addition to eight trunk segments (numbered). (C) Alignment and serial homology of anterior appendages in Onychophora and the four major arthropod groups [after [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]]. Note that the onychophoran eyes (black filled circle) may be homologous to the median ocelli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] rather than to the compound eyes of arthropods (checked ovals), although all these ocular structures belong to the same, anterior-most body segment. Abbreviations: as, antennal segment; at, antenna; at1, first antenna; at2, second antenna; ch, chelicera; jw, jaw; js, jaw segment; le, leg; md, mandible; mx, maxilla; pp, pedipalp; sp, slime papilla; ss, slime papilla segment.</p>
