abstract: " UNLABELLED:  BACKGROUND: The biting mandible of the arthropods is thought to have evolved in the ancestor of the insects, crustaceans and myriapods: the Mandibulata. A unique origin suggests a common set of developmental genes will be required to pattern the mandible in different arthropods. To date we have functional studies on patterning of the mandibular segment of Drosophila melanogaster showing in particular the effects of the gene cap'n'collar (cnc), however, the dipteran head is far from representative of insects or of more distantly related mandibulates; Drosophila does not even possess a mandibular appendage. To study the development of a more representative insect mandible, we chose the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and investigated the function of the Tribolium orthologs of cap'n'collar (Tc-cnc) and the Hox gene Deformed (Tc-Dfd). In order to determine the function of Tc-cnc and Tc-Dfd, transcripts were knocked down by maternal RNA interference (RNAi). The effects of gene knockdown were examined in the developing embryos and larvae. The effect of Tc-cnc and Tc-Dfd knockdown on the expression of other genes was determined by using in situ hybridization on Tribolium embryos. RESULTS: Our analyses show that Tc-cnc is required for specification of the identity of the mandibular segment of Tribolium and differentiates the mandible from maxillary identity. Loss of Tc-cnc function results in a transformation of the mandible to maxillary identity as well as deletion of the labrum. Tc-Dfd and the Tribolium homolog of proboscipedia (Tc-mxp = maxillopedia), Hox genes that are required to pattern the maxillary appendage, are expressed in a maxilla-like manner in the transformed mandible. Tribolium homologs of paired (Tc-prd) and Distal-less (Tc-Dll) that are expressed in the endites and telopodites of embryonic appendages are also expressed in a maxilla-like manner in the transformed mandible.We also show that Tc-Dfd is required to activate the collar of Tc-cnc expression in the mandibular segment but not the cap expression in the labrum. Tc-Dfd is also required for the activation of Tc-prd in the endites of the mandible and maxillary appendages. CONCLUSIONS: Tc-cnc is necessary for patterning the mandibular segment of Tribolium. Together, Tc-cnc and Tc-Dfd cooperate to specify mandibular identity, as in Drosophila. Expression patterns of the homologs of cnc and Dfd are conserved in mandibulate arthropods suggesting that the mandible specifying function of cnc is likely to be conserved across the mandibulate arthropods."

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Expression of *****Tc-Dfd, Tc-mxp *****and *****Tc-prd *****in dissected embryonic mandibles and maxillae.** All views are ventral with anterior to the left unless otherwise indicated. Gene expression was determined by *in situ* hybridization. (**A,C**) Lateral view of the mandibular and maxillary appendages showing *Tc-Dfd* expression (blue) in a germ band fully retracted stage embryo. (A) *Tc-Dfd* expression is repressed from the developing mandibular endite, which consists of an inner lobe (arrowhead) and an outer lobe (arrow). (**B**) Embryo stained with *Tc-mxp* (red) and *Tc-prd* (blue). *Tc-mxp* is expressed in the maxillary and labial palps and the distal protopodite of both appendages. In the maxilla, protopodite expression relates to the position of the developing galea endite lobe (asterisk), which is marked by the distal domain of *Tc-prd* expression. *Tc-mxp* is expressed in the mesoderm of the mandibular limb bud (arrowhead). The intercalary domain of *Tc-mxp* expression is also visible (white arrowhead). Mesodermal expression of *Tc-prd* is present in the telopodites of post-antennal appendages but clearly visible in the developing leg appendages (arrow). (**C**) *Tc-Dfd* expression is missing from the outer lobe of the mandible (arrow). (**D,E**) *Tc-Dfd* expression (red) and *Tc-prd* expression (blue) in a dissected mandible and maxilla of a post germ band retracted stage embryo undergoing dorsal closure. Distal is top. (**D**) Lateral view of a dissected mandible. *Tc-Dfd* expression remains on the lateral side of the mandible (arrow). (**E**) Dissected maxilla, lateral is to the right. *Tc-Dfd* expression is throughout the protopodite and at the base of the palp. The distal part of the palp is lacking or has weak *Tc-Dfd* expression (arrow).</p>
