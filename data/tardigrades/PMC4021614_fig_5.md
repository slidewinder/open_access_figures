abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Onychophora are a probable sister group to Arthropoda, one of the most intensively studied animal phyla from a developmental perspective. Pioneering work on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and subsequent investigation of other arthropods has revealed important roles for Wnt genes during many developmental processes in these animals. RESULTS: We screened the embryonic transcriptome of the onychophoran Euperipatoides kanangrensis and found that at least 11 Wnt genes are expressed during embryogenesis. These genes represent 11 of the 13 known subfamilies of Wnt genes. CONCLUSIONS: Many onychophoran Wnt genes are expressed in segment polarity gene-like patterns, suggesting a general role for these ligands during segment regionalization, as has been described in arthropods. During early stages of development, Wnt2, Wnt4, and Wnt5 are expressed in broad multiple segment-wide domains that are reminiscent of arthropod gap and Hox gene expression patterns, which suggests an early instructive role for Wnt genes during E. kanangrensis segmentation.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Expression of *****E. kanangrensis Wnt4.*** Anterior is to the left. **(A)** Ventral view. Red arrow marks the anterior border of expression. **(B)** Lateral view. **(C)** Embryo of **(B)**, ventral view. Arrowhead indicates lack of expression in the posterior pit region. **(D)** Lateral view. **(E)** Anterior portion of embryo and close-up of jaw. Note that expression in the jaw is only in the mesoderm. **(F)** Ventrolateral view. Arrows indicate expression between the bases of the limbs. Asterisks mark expression in the ventral nervous system. **(G)** Embryo of **(F)**. Close-up of slime-papillae-bearing segment. Arrowhead indicates staining in salivary gland. Asterisk marks expression in the ventral nervous system. **(H)** Embryo of **(F)**. Close-up of head. Arrow and arrowhead indicate dot-like expression at base of frontal appendage. Note that expression in the frontal appendage is mesodermal. **(A′)**, **(G′)** and **(H′)** represent DAPI staining of the embryos of **(A)**, **(G)** and **(H)**. fap, frontal appendage; hl, head lobe; j, jaw; L1, first walking-limb-bearing segment; m-a, mouth-anus furrow; pp, posterior pit region; sp, slime papilla; st, stage.</p>
