abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Onychophora are a probable sister group to Arthropoda, one of the most intensively studied animal phyla from a developmental perspective. Pioneering work on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and subsequent investigation of other arthropods has revealed important roles for Wnt genes during many developmental processes in these animals. RESULTS: We screened the embryonic transcriptome of the onychophoran Euperipatoides kanangrensis and found that at least 11 Wnt genes are expressed during embryogenesis. These genes represent 11 of the 13 known subfamilies of Wnt genes. CONCLUSIONS: Many onychophoran Wnt genes are expressed in segment polarity gene-like patterns, suggesting a general role for these ligands during segment regionalization, as has been described in arthropods. During early stages of development, Wnt2, Wnt4, and Wnt5 are expressed in broad multiple segment-wide domains that are reminiscent of arthropod gap and Hox gene expression patterns, which suggests an early instructive role for Wnt genes during E. kanangrensis segmentation.'

### Figure 8
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Expression of *****E. kanangrensis Wnt9 *****and *****Wnt10*****. (A-F)** Expression of *Wnt9*. **(G-J)** Expression of *Wnt10*. Anterior is to the left. **(A)** Ventral view. Ubiquitous expression. **(B**) Lateral view. **(C)** Lateral view. **(D)** Ventrolateral view. **(E)** Ventral view. Anterior part of an embryo. **(F)** Ventral view. Close-up of the slime-papillae-bearing segment. Note the transverse stripe of expression (asterisk) that is level with the opening of the salivary gland (arrowhead) (cf. **F**′). **(G)** Lateral view. **(H)** Lateral view. **(I)** Ventral view, focused on the anterior of the embryo. **(J)** View of two slightly different angles of the same area of the embryo showing the slime-papillae-bearing segment. Note that the transverse stripe of expression is level with the posterior region of the salivary gland opening. **(F′)** and **(I′)** represent DAPI staining of the embryos of **(F)** and **(I)**. fap, frontal appendage; hl, head lobe; j, jaw; L1, first walking-limb-bearing segment; pp, posterior pit region; sp, slime papilla; st, stage.</p>
