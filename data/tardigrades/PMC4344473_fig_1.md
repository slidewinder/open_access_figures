<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Dynamic evolution of transposon-silencing pathways.</title> The activity of transposons is recognized at the level of RNA, and transposons are silenced either posttranscriptionally (through RNA cleavage) or transcriptionally (through chromatin modification and/or DNA methylation). Symbols indicate pathways used for defense against transposons in each species; note the differences within the nematode phylumâ€”Clade I and II nematodes are represented by *T*. *spiralis*, Clades III and IV by *B*. *malayi*, and Clade V by *C*. *elegans*.</p>
