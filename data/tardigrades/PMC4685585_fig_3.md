abstract: 'The origin and extreme diversification of the animal nervous system is a central question in biology. While most of the attention has traditionally been paid to those lineages with highly elaborated nervous systems (e.g. arthropods, vertebrates, annelids), only the study of the vast animal diversity can deliver a comprehensive view of the evolutionary history of this organ system. In this regard, the phylogenetic position and apparently conservative molecular, morphological and embryological features of priapulid worms (Priapulida) place this animal lineage as a key to understanding the evolution of the Ecdysozoa (i.e. arthropods and nematodes). In this study, we characterize the nervous system of the hatching larva and first lorica larva of the priapulid worm Priapulus caudatus by immunolabelling against acetylated and tyrosinated tubulin, pCaMKII, serotonin and FMRFamide. Our results show that a circumoral brain and an unpaired ventral nerve with a caudal ganglion characterize the central nervous system of hatching embryos. After the first moult, the larva attains some adult features: a neck ganglion, an introvert plexus, and conspicuous secondary longitudinal neurites. Our study delivers a neuroanatomical framework for future embryological studies in priapulid worms, and helps illuminate the course of nervous system evolution in the Ecdysozoa.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The larval serotonergic nervous system of *P. caudatus*. (*a–e*) Maximal *z*-projections of confocal stacks of whole mount larvae stained with antisera against serotonin (*a–c*, in grey; *d* and *e*, in red) or tyrosinated tubulin (TyrTub; *d* and *e*, in grey) and counterstained with the nuclear marker Sytox Green (red, in *a*,*c*). (*a*) The serotonergic nervous system of the hatching larva comprises perikarya around the circumoral brain (yellow arrows), an axonal tract in the ventral nerve (green arrowheads) and one cell at the caudal ganglion (brown arrowhead). (*b*) Magnification of the squared region in (*a*). Serotonergic cells in the brain are bipolar, with one axon projecting towards the anterior end (white arrowheads) and the other one projecting towards the neuropil (yellow arrows; ventral nerve indicated by green arrowheads). (*c*) In the first lorica larva, the number of serotonin-positive cells in the brain increases (yellow arrows), the ventral nerve (green arrowheads) is more conspicuous and one serotonin-positive cell is still observed in the caudal ganglion (brown arrowhead). (*d*) The serotonin-positive cells are located anterior to the neuropil (yellow arrows, as observed with TyrTub; the blue arrowheads indicate the neck ganglion, and the green arrowheads the ventral nerve), with the anterior cells projecting one axon towards the scalids (white arrowhead). (*e*) In the posterior region, the serotonergic cell of the caudal ganglion (brown arrowhead) projects its posterior axon (white arrowhead) outside the ventral nerve (green arrowheads). In all cases, the asterisk indicates the position of the mouth. All panels are ventral–lateral views. an, anus; sc, scalids. Scale bars, 25 µm in all panels.</p>
