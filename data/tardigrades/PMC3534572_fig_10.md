abstract: " UNLABELLED:  BACKGROUND: The biting mandible of the arthropods is thought to have evolved in the ancestor of the insects, crustaceans and myriapods: the Mandibulata. A unique origin suggests a common set of developmental genes will be required to pattern the mandible in different arthropods. To date we have functional studies on patterning of the mandibular segment of Drosophila melanogaster showing in particular the effects of the gene cap'n'collar (cnc), however, the dipteran head is far from representative of insects or of more distantly related mandibulates; Drosophila does not even possess a mandibular appendage. To study the development of a more representative insect mandible, we chose the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and investigated the function of the Tribolium orthologs of cap'n'collar (Tc-cnc) and the Hox gene Deformed (Tc-Dfd). In order to determine the function of Tc-cnc and Tc-Dfd, transcripts were knocked down by maternal RNA interference (RNAi). The effects of gene knockdown were examined in the developing embryos and larvae. The effect of Tc-cnc and Tc-Dfd knockdown on the expression of other genes was determined by using in situ hybridization on Tribolium embryos. RESULTS: Our analyses show that Tc-cnc is required for specification of the identity of the mandibular segment of Tribolium and differentiates the mandible from maxillary identity. Loss of Tc-cnc function results in a transformation of the mandible to maxillary identity as well as deletion of the labrum. Tc-Dfd and the Tribolium homolog of proboscipedia (Tc-mxp = maxillopedia), Hox genes that are required to pattern the maxillary appendage, are expressed in a maxilla-like manner in the transformed mandible. Tribolium homologs of paired (Tc-prd) and Distal-less (Tc-Dll) that are expressed in the endites and telopodites of embryonic appendages are also expressed in a maxilla-like manner in the transformed mandible.We also show that Tc-Dfd is required to activate the collar of Tc-cnc expression in the mandibular segment but not the cap expression in the labrum. Tc-Dfd is also required for the activation of Tc-prd in the endites of the mandible and maxillary appendages. CONCLUSIONS: Tc-cnc is necessary for patterning the mandibular segment of Tribolium. Together, Tc-cnc and Tc-Dfd cooperate to specify mandibular identity, as in Drosophila. Expression patterns of the homologs of cnc and Dfd are conserved in mandibulate arthropods suggesting that the mandible specifying function of cnc is likely to be conserved across the mandibulate arthropods."

### Figure 10
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Hypothetical evolution of the mandible patterning function of *****cnc *****in embryos in the stem lineage of the mandibulate arthropods.** (**A**) The post-antennal limbs of stem-lineage mandibulates are serially homologous biramous limbs with multiple endites, represented here as a single lobe for clarity, on the medial part of the protopodite. (**B**) Hypothetical expression of *Dfd* in a lobopod, the ancestor to all arthropods (and closely related taxa such as the Onychophora) based on expression of *Dfd* in an onychophoran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Here, *Dfd* is expressed proximally in monopodial limbs with the anterior limit at the segment homologous to the first leg segment (L1) of chelicerates and onychophorans. (**C**) Hypothetical expression of *Dfd* in a hypothetical non-mandibulate ancestor to Mandibulata. (**D**) Expression of *cnc* and *Dfd* in a hypothetical ancestor to the mandibulate arthropods (Pancrustacea and Myriapoda). The mandibular segment identity is specified by *cnc.* We hypothesize that the mandible patterning function of *cnc* evolved in the stem lineage of the mandibulate arthropods. The mandibular and maxillary segments of mandibulates are homologous to the first and second leg segments of chelicerates and onychophorans. (**E**) Expression of *Dfd* in chelicerates based upon *Dfd* expression in spiders. There are two homologs of *Dfd* in spiders, both of which are expressed in the L1 to L4 segments. (**F**) Expression of *Dfd* in an onychophoran. (**G**) The mandibular gnathal edge, consisting of an incisor and molar, most likely evolved from the proximal endite (star) on the primitive biramous limb present in species such as *Martinssonia*. The other more distal endites were lost at some point. Labels are: antenna (An), first leg (L1), jaws (J), labrum (La), mandible (Mn), maxilla (Mx), maxilla-like mandible precursor (Mn*), primary antenna (Pa), second antenna (An2), second leg (L2), slime papilla (Sp).</p>
