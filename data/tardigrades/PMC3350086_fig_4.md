abstract: 'Robustness has been studied through the analysis of data sets, simulations, and a variety of experimental techniques that each have their own limitations but together confirm the ubiquity of biological robustness. Recent trends suggest that different types of perturbation (e.g., mutational, environmental) are commonly stabilized by similar mechanisms, and system sensitivities often display a long-tailed distribution with relatively few perturbations representing the majority of sensitivities. Conceptual paradigms from network theory, control theory, complexity science, and natural selection have been used to understand robustness, however each paradigm has a limited scope of applicability and there has been little discussion of the conditions that determine this scope or the relationships between paradigms. Systems properties such as modularity, bow-tie architectures, degeneracy, and other topological features are often positively associated with robust traits, however common underlying mechanisms are rarely mentioned. For instance, many system properties support robustness through functional redundancy or through response diversity with responses regulated by competitive exclusion and cooperative facilitation. Moreover, few studies compare and contrast alternative strategies for achieving robustness such as homeostasis, adaptive plasticity, environment shaping, and environment tracking. These strategies share similarities in their utilization of adaptive and self-organization processes that are not well appreciated yet might be suggestive of reusable building blocks for generating robust behavior.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Thymic selection of T cells**. Immature T cells (called thymocytes) enter the thymic cortex and undergo differentiation. During this time TCR re-arrangement occurs until an active TCR is expressed along with both the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors. Those thymocytes that have a functional TCR and survive commit to a single positive (SP) state (SP thymocytes express either CD4 or CD8, but not both), and migrate to the thymic medulla. Here, SP thymocytes systematically scan medullary thymic epithelial cells and dendritic cells presenting self-peptides in their MHC molecules. During the SP thymocyte stage, any thymocyte that expresses a TCR that has an above threshold affinity to self-peptides undergoes apoptosis and dies. Surviving thymocytes eventually exit the thymus and enter the periphery as mature, naïve T cells. Positive and negative selection is determined by TCR affinity to their peptide/MHC ligand. Once a TCR is expressed on the cell surface it immediately begins interacting with MHC molecules presenting self-peptides. Functional TCR’s generate a basal signal output that, although insufficient to cross the activation threshold, is still necessary for thymocyte survival. TCR’s that cannot recognize peptide/MHC complexes ultimately die by neglect. Surviving thymocytes then migrate to the thymic medulla where they are exposed to self-antigen. Any TCR that reacts with a self-peptide with too high of an affinity will induce T cell activation and apoptosis. Only thymocytes with a functional TCR, which is competent to trigger low-level signaling but does not cross the activation threshold to self-peptides, is positively selected and permitted to exit the thymus.
