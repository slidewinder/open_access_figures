abstract: "BACKGROUND: The tardigrades (water bears) are a cosmopolitan group of microscopic ecdysozoans found in a variety of aquatic and temporarily wet environments. They are members of the Panarthropoda (Tardigrada + Onychophora + Arthropoda), although their exact position within this group remains contested. Studies of embryonic development in tardigrades have been scarce and have yielded contradictory data. Therefore, we investigated the development of the nervous system in embryos of the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini using immunohistochemical techniques in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy in an effort to gain insight into the evolution of the nervous system in panarthropods. RESULTS: An antiserum against acetylated α-tubulin was used to visualize the axonal processes and general neuroanatomy in whole-mount embryos of the eutardigrade H. dujardini. Our data reveal that the tardigrade nervous system develops in an anterior-to-posterior gradient, beginning with the neural structures of the head. The brain develops as a dorsal, bilaterally symmetric structure and contains a single developing central neuropil. The stomodeal nervous system develops separately and includes at least four separate, ring-like commissures. A circumbuccal nerve ring arises late in development and innervates the circumoral sensory field. The segmental trunk ganglia likewise arise from anterior to posterior and establish links with each other via individual pioneering axons. Each hemiganglion is associated with a number of peripheral nerves, including a pair of leg nerves and a branched, dorsolateral nerve. CONCLUSIONS: The revealed pattern of brain development supports a single-segmented brain in tardigrades and challenges previous assignments of homology between tardigrade brain lobes and arthropod brain segments. Likewise, the tardigrade circumbuccal nerve ring cannot be homologized with the arthropod 'circumoral' nerve ring, suggesting that this structure is unique to tardigrades. Finally, we propose that the segmental ganglia of tardigrades and arthropods are homologous and, based on these data, favor a hypothesis that supports tardigrades as the sister group of arthropods."

<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Neural development in embryos of *Hypsibius dujardini* in ventral view*.* Maximum CLSM projections of embryos of successive developmental stages labeled for acetylated α-tubulin. Asterisks indicate the position of the future mouth. **(A)** Overview of development from earliest (left) to latest (right) stages analyzed. Note that the nervous system develops from anterior to posterior. **(B-E)** Details of subsequent developmental stages. Note that the anteroventral cells arise early in development (in (B)) and that the inner connectives are formed prior to the outer connectives (in (C)). Peripheral neurons arise only after the central nervous system has been established (in (D)). **(E)** A nearly complete embryo with the developing anlage of the gonad already present. Abbreviations: av, anteroventral cells; br, brain cells; c1, central commissure of the first trunk ganglion; cb, developing central brain neuropil (arising from a single commissure); g1, g2, anlagen of the first and second trunk ganglia; go, gonad anlage; ic, inner connectives; lg, leg ganglion; nr, circumbuccal nerve ring; oc, outer connective; pn, peripheral neuron.
