abstract: 'It is the first time that Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), causing potentially lethal disease of humans, has been reported from the Middle East region and from the tortoise tick Hyalomma aegyptium from a tortoise host, whose epidemiological significance may have remained almost completely overlooked so far. We used RT-PCR to screen for 245 ticks collected from 38 Testudo graeca tortoise individuals. Results of our genetic screening provide unambiguous evidence of occurrence of CCHFV in this region and host, suggesting a potentially important role of H. aegyptium in CCHF epidemiology.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Bayesian phylogeny of the known haplotypes of CCHFV.** Terminal branches of the main geographically-defined clades were collapsed to ease orientation. Note the paraphyletic nature of the European and African clades as opposed to the monophyletic Asian clade. The heights of collapsed clades are proportional to the number of their haplotypes and the lengths of branches leading to the last common ancestor of each main clade reflect their nucleotide divergence. Detail is given for the sub-clade containing haplotype of our samples from Levant illustrating its clear relationship to African CCHFV haplotypes. The numbers at branches show tree support as Bayesian posterior probabilities/maximum likelihood bootstraps (after 1000 resampled datasets) for each particular branch. Values below 0.5/50 are not shown.</p>
