abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 16
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Quick length changes of small amplitudes on isolated frog muscle fibres during tetanic stimulation (all figures from A. Huxley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b238-ijms-09-02658">238</xref>]; with permission).  (a) Tension curve of a quick stretch 1.5 nm (top panel) and quick releases of 1.5 nm, 3 nm, 4.5 nm and 6 nm. The length change, shown in the bottom panel, is complete in 0.2 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b219-ijms-09-02658">219</xref>]. (b) Tension transient response in an ideal Voigt element, i.e. spring in series with parallel combination of spring and dashpot. T<sub>1</sub> extreme tension reached, T<sub>2</sub> tension approached asymptotically. Both T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> give straight lines when plotted against the size of the imposed step change of length. (c) T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> curves constructed from a family of records as shown in (a) (sarcomere length 2.3 μm). Approximate changes of the Z-filament stages are added and some possible displacement by drilling is indicated by arrows. (d) The fibre with the T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> plots (crosses) shown in (c) stretched to sarcomere length 3.l μm, i.e. the overlap is reduced to approx. 39 %. The tension curves (crosses) scaled down by the factor 0.39 (from Huxley and Simmons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b226-ijms-09-02658">226</xref>]).</p>
