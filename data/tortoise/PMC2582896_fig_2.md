abstract: 'The kinesin-13 motor protein family members drive the removal of tubulin from microtubules (MTs) to promote MT turnover. A point mutation of the kinesin-13 family member mitotic centromere-associated kinesin/Kif2C (E491A) isolates the tubulin-removal conformation of the motor, and appears distinct from all previously described kinesin-13 conformations derived from nucleotide analogues. The E491A mutant removes tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs stoichiometrically in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but is unable to efficiently release from detached tubulin dimers to recycle catalytically. Only in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) can the mutant catalytically remove tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs because the affinity of the mutant for detached tubulin dimers in ADP is low relative to lattice-bound tubulin. Thus, the motor can regenerate for further cycles of disassembly. Using the mutant, we show that release of tubulin by kinesin-13 motors occurs at the transition state for ATP hydrolysis, which illustrates a significant divergence in their coupling to ATP turnover relative to motile kinesins.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**The effect of various nucleotides and E491A mutation on equilibrium binding of MCAK to tubulin dimers.** (A) Tubulin-binding assays with 700 nM MCAK, 150 μM of indicated nucleotide, and bound versus unbound bovine brain tubulin. (B) Dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) from fit curves. (C) Comparison of tubulin retention by wt MCAK and E491A in various nucleotides (1.6 mM) and a constant concentration of tubulin (2 μM). The percentage of tubulin dimer bound to the motor in each nucleotide and standard deviation from the mean (SD) are indicated. All lanes, respectively, are run on the same gel but the order of the lanes in E491A (bottom) are arranged to correspond to the nucleotide order of wt MCAK (top).</p>
