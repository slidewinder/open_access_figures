abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 7
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Proliferation within the subventricular zone after traumatic brain injury (TBI). **(A–D)** Overall proliferation within the subventricular zone (SVZ) was quantified using Ki67 to immunolabel actively dividing cells **(A**, images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>**)** and a BrdU pulse-chase protocol to label endogenous cycling cells before injury and monitor the postinjury response **(B–D)**. The density of Ki67-immunolabeled cells in the SVZ is similar across post-TBI (1.5-mm impact) time points, indicating that there is not a significant difference of cells actively dividing within the SVZ at the time of tissue analysis (p = 0.702; n = 3 mice per time point) **(A)**. BrdU was administered 1 day before TBI, and cells were analyzed in the SVZ at 1, 3, and 7 days after TBI **(B–D)**. Age-matched naive mice were injected with BrdU and perfused in parallel. Quantification of BrdU immunohistochemistry shows similar values in the SVZ for each time point **(B**, for each time point, n = 3 naive, n = 5 injured**)**. Coronal sections illustrating BrdU-immunolabeled cells in the SVZ for a BrdU pulse-chase shown at 1 day after TBI **(D)** and for a matched naive mouse **(C)**. **(E–H)** NG2 immunohistochemistry to determine the oligodendrocyte progenitor response in the SVZ relative to axonal injury in the overlying corpus callosum (CC). Coronal sections illustrate BrdU pulse-chase shown at 3 days after TBI **(F)** and at matched time point for a naive mouse **(E)**. Arrows denote examples of NG2 cells in SVZ. Arrowheads indicate examples of BrdU-labeled nuclei **(E, F)**. The total NG2 cell density remained constant throughout the first week after injury **(G)**. The proportion of NG2 cells labeled with BrdU indicates that the proliferative response changes significantly in the injured mice relative to the matched naive time points **(H**; **, p = 0.0047 for 1 day; p = 0.0058 for 3 days; n = 3 naive and n = 5 TBI for each time point**)**. Scale bars = **(C, D**, shown in **D)** 100 μm; **(E, F**, shown in **F)** 100 μm. LV = lateral ventricle.</p>
