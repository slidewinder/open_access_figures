abstract: 'We show that light trapped in an optical cavity can be extracted from that cavity in an ultrashort burst by means of a trigger pulse. We find a simple analytic description of this process and show that while the extracted pulse inherits its pulse length from that of the trigger pulse, its wavelength can be completely different. Cavity Optical Pulse Extraction is thus well suited for the development of ultrashort laser sources in new wavelength ranges. We discuss similarities between this process and the generation of Hawking radiation at the optical analogue of an event horizon with extremely high Hawking temperature. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by thorough numerical simulations.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Symmetry of positive energy and negative energy photons generated in the COPE process.</title> (a) Real and imaginary parts of the spectrum of the COPE pulse for a cavity with κ<sub>0</sub> = 0.6 mm<sup>−1</sup>, a length *L* = 10 mm and a TP FWHM of 5 ps with clamping parameter *α* = 0.01. Superimposing the spectrum and its frequency inverted counterpart shows that the positive and negative frequency components are conjugates, as expected for Hawking radiation. (b) The positive and negative energy of (black) a weak cavity with κ<sub>0</sub> = 0.3 mm<sup>−1</sup> and (red) a strong cavity with κ<sub>0</sub> = 0.6 mm<sup>−1</sup> and a TP FWHM of 12 ps versus the clamping parameter *α*, and thus the TP power, calculated numerically from Eqs.
