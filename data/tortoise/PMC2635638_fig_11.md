abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 11
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The force-velocity relation.  (a) A long electromotor-driven rotating screw-coil (well lubricated) lifts its nut with a plate for weights. (b) Its force-velocity relations are straight lines that depend on the electromotoric force 6V or 12V, as shown (from Jarosch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74-ijms-09-02658">74</xref>]). (c) The force-velocity relations of muscle are hyperbolae that depend on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (from Julian *et al.* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b181-ijms-09-02658">181</xref>]; with permission). (d) The curvature of the curves indicated with a, b and c increases with time at the beginning of an isometric tetanus (curve a: 0.32 P<sub>0</sub>, 75 ms after the first stimulation, curve b: 0.50 P<sub>0</sub> after 100 ms, curve c: l.00 P<sub>0</sub>, after 190 ms). The steady force for a given velocity increases with time (from Cecchi *et al.* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b158-ijms-09-02658">158</xref>]; with permission). The force-velocity of muscle would be linear (as the curves in (b), or the added dashed line in (d), or the velocity curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f23-ijms-09-02658">Figure 23</xref>), when only the load would increase, but the torsional force would remain constant. Since also the torsional driving force increases from Z-filament twisting stage A to D, as indicated, the relation is a hyperbola. (e) Deviation of the force-velocity curve from an exact hyperbola in the high force region (from Edman *et al.* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b185-ijms-09-02658">185</xref>]; with permission). Here, all twisting stages may be shifted so, that stage D is already reached by a slow drilling velocity.</p>
