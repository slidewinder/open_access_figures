abstract: 'We show that light trapped in an optical cavity can be extracted from that cavity in an ultrashort burst by means of a trigger pulse. We find a simple analytic description of this process and show that while the extracted pulse inherits its pulse length from that of the trigger pulse, its wavelength can be completely different. Cavity Optical Pulse Extraction is thus well suited for the development of ultrashort laser sources in new wavelength ranges. We discuss similarities between this process and the generation of Hawking radiation at the optical analogue of an event horizon with extremely high Hawking temperature. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by thorough numerical simulations.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Schematic of the COPE setup.</title> A cw-laser (green wave) excites a cavity mode (green arch) in a FBG cavity (striped cylinder). A counter propagating TP (red pulse) interacts with the energy stored in the cavity and extracts a short pulse, with the same wavelength as the cavity mode (green pulse, superimposed on red pulse). (Inset) Refractive index modulation (blue) and modal profile at the Bragg wavelength (red) of three fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). (a) Uniform FBG. (b) Uniform FBG cavity with *Ï€*-phase shift in the center. (c) Sinusoidal FBG cavity as discussed in this paper.</p>
