abstract: 'Sarcopenia and dynapenia pose significant problems for the aged, especially as life expectancy rises in developed countries. Current therapies are marginally efficacious at best, and barriers to breakthroughs in treatment may result from currently employed model organisms. Here, we argue that the use of indeterminate-growing teleost fish in skeletal muscle aging research may lead to therapeutic advancements not possible with current mammalian models. Evidence from a comparative approach utilizing the subfamily Danioninae suggests that the indeterminate growth paradigm of many teleosts arises from adult muscle stem cells with greater proliferative capacity, even in spite of smaller progenitor populations. We hypothesize that paired-box transcription factors, Pax3/7, are involved with this enhanced self-renewal and that prolonged expression of these factors may allow some fish species to escape, or at least forestall, sarcopenia/dynapenia. Future research efforts should focus on the experimental validation of these genes as key factors in indeterminate growth, both in the context of muscle stem cell proliferation and in prevention of skeletal muscle senescence.

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Working model of opposing growth paradigms.** Stimulation of somatic growth by growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) leads to prolonged Pax3/7 expression, resulting in enhanced myogenic precursor cell (MPC) proliferation, expansion of myoblast (Mb) progeny and increased self-renewal of the stem cell niche. Downstream of these effects, differential fusion potential results largely in hypertrophy of existing fibers in determinate organisms (i.e., mammals) and nascent fiber recruitment in indeterminate organisms (i.e., many fish). At the most ultimate level, a growth plateau (or asymptote) may predispose animals to sarcopenia, while the presence of lifelong, indeterminate growth may preclude senescence, including sarcopenia/dynapenia.</p>
