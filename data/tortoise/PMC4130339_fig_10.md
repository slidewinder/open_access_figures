abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 10
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The oligodendrocyte-myelin unit is altered during the secondary injury stage after traumatic brain injury (TBI). **(A, B)** A coronal section immunolabeled for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to detect myelin and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to examine astrogliosis. MOG immunoreactivity appeared less intense in regions of astrogliosis **(A)**, but the myelinated area in the corpus callosum was not significantly different between sham and mice with TBI throughout the first week of injury **(B)**. **(C–L)***Plp/CreER<sup>T</sup>:R26IAP* reporter mice were used to test the ability of oligodendrocytes to synthesize alkaline phosphatase (AP; a membrane-associated reporter molecule), transport AP along processes, and incorporate AP into myelin sheaths **(C)**. *Plp/CreER<sup>T</sup>:R26IAP* mice were administered tamoxifen to induce recombination and expression of AP via inversion of the floxed AP second exon. Tamoxifen (Tam) induction was used to visualize AP labeling of myelin during either a primary injury stage (0–2 days) or during a secondary injury stage (2–7 days) **(D)**. AP incorporation into myelin was apparent as a blue substrate reaction in coronal brain sections, particularly in the corpus callosum **(E–H)**. **(I–L)** Quantification of the area of AP labeling took into account variation in the intensity of signal among regions of the corpus callosum. During the primary injury stage, the sham and TBI (1.5 mm impact) mice had similar proportions of labeling within the corpus callosum for all AP intensities **(I)**. During the secondary injury stage, the overall proportion of the corpus callosum labeled was not different, but there was a shift among the areas based on AP intensity **(K)**. A weighted AP intensity index **(J, L)** was used to semiquantitatively compare the AP-labeled areas while taking into account the relative area exhibiting low, medium, and high AP levels. The AP intensity index is significantly increased in TBI versus sham only mice during the secondary injury phase **(L**; *, p = 0.0260**)**. Sample size of cohorts was n = 12 for was primary injury stage (6 sham, 6 TBI) and n = 11 for secondary injury stage (5 sham, 6 TBI). Scale bars = **(A)** 200 μm; **(E–H**, shown in **E)** 200 μm.</p>
