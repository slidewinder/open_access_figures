abstract: 'Disturbances such as fire, land clearing, and road building remove vegetation and can have major influences on public health through effects on air quality, aesthetics, recreational opportunities, natural resource availability, and economics. Plant recovery and succession following disturbance are poorly understood in arid lands relative to more temperate regions. This study quantitatively reviewed vegetation reestablishment following a variety of disturbances in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of southwestern North America. A total of 47 studies met inclusion criteria for the review. The time estimated by 29 individual studies for full reestablishment of total perennial plant cover was 76 years. Although long, this time was shorter than an estimated 215 years (among 31 individual studies) required for the recovery of species composition typical of undisturbed areas, assuming that recovery remains linear following the longest time since disturbance measurement made by the studies.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Examples of studies that examined time since disturbance (TSD) relationships with variables of plant recovery in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of the American Southwest. Plant cover and richness are expressed as the percent of levels found on undisturbed areas ([disturbed/undisturbed] Ã— 100). **(a)** Perennial plant cover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ijerph-07-01248">51</xref>]. **(b)** Perennial plant cover using data from 29 individual studies that each made one TSD measurement. **(c)** Annual plant cover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-ijerph-07-01248">67</xref>]. **(d)** Perennial species richness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ijerph-07-01248">51</xref>]. **(e)** Perennial species richness using data from 30 individual studies that each made one TSD measurement. **(f)** Annual plant richness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-ijerph-07-01248">67</xref>]. **(g)** Disturbed:undisturbed similarity of perennial species composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ijerph-07-01248">51</xref>]. **(h)** Disturbed:undisturbed similarity of perennial species composition using data from 31 individual studies that each made one TSD measurement. **(i)** Disturbed:undisturbed similarity of annual species composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-ijerph-07-01248">67</xref>].</p>
