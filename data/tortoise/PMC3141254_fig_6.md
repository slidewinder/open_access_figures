abstract: 'RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs (ADARs) can be both specific and non-specific, depending on the substrate. Specific editing of particular adenosines may depend on the overall sequence and structural context. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying these preferences are not fully understood. Here, we show that duplex structures mimicking an editing site in the Gabra3 pre-mRNA unexpectedly fail to support RNA editing at the Gabra3 I/M site, although phylogenetic analysis suggest an evolutionarily conserved duplex structure essential for efficient RNA editing. These unusual results led us to revisit the structural requirement for this editing by mutagenesis analysis. In vivo nuclear injection experiments of mutated editing substrates demonstrate that a non-conserved structure is a determinant for editing. This structure contains bulges either on the same or the strand opposing the edited adenosine. The position of these bulges and the distance to the edited base regulate editing. Moreover, elevated folding temperature can lead to a switch in RNA editing suggesting an RNA structural change. Our results indicate the importance of RNA tertiary structure in determining RNA editing.'

### Figure 6
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>RNA editing is modulated by a structural switch at the non-conserved region. (**A**) Predicted RNA secondary structure of the 46-nt Gabra3 substrates and mutants. A series of mutants was analysed where nucleotides at the non-conserved region were mutated (enclosed in square). In all cases, the RNA architecture is identical except for the variable region (shaded in colour). The structural shape at the variable region is important for editing. Edited architectures are shaded in blue, while unedited architectures are shaded in yellow. A red cross marks the failure to detect RNA editing (&lt;5%). (**B**) Editing levels of the various mutant transcripts after injection *Xenopus* oocyte nuclei. Data are expressed as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. (**C**) A structural switch at the non-conserved region is a determinant for editing. All examined substrates could be confined to two different shapes. A proximal bulges on the same strand of the edited A inhibits editing, while a distant bulge on the same strand is compatible with editing. ****P* &lt; 0.001 compared with each other (using the Student's *t*-test).</p>
