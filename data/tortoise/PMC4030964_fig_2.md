abstract: 'In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are self-reproducing organelles with their own DNA and they play a central role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by respiration. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondria also have critical and multiple functions in the initiation of cell differentiation, cell-type determination, cell movement, and pattern formation. This has been most strikingly realized in development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium. For example, the expression of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4 (mt-rps4) gene is required for the initial differentiation. The Dictyostelium homologue (Dd-TRAP1) of TRAP-1 (tumor necrosis receptor-associated protein 1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone belonging to the Hsp90 family, allows the prompt transition of cells from growth to differentiation through a novel prestarvation factor (PSF-3) in growth medium. Moreover, a cell-type-specific organelle named a prespore-specific vacuole (PSV) is constructed by mitochondrial transformation with the help of the Golgi complex. Mitochondria are also closely involved in a variety of cellular activities including CN-resistant respiration and apoptosis. These mitochondrial functions are reviewed in this article, with special emphasis on the regulation of Dictyostelium development.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>A growth/differentiation checkpoint (GDT point) in the cell cycle of a *Dictyostelium discoideum* Ax-2 cell. The doubling time of axenically growing Ax-2 cells is about 7.2 h and most of their cell cycle is composed of G2-phase with little or no G1-phase and a short period of M- and S-phases. A specific checkpoint (referred to as the GDT point) of GDT is located at the mid–late G2-phase (just after T7 and just before T0). Ax-2 cells progress through their cell cycle to the GDT point, irrespective of the presence or absence of nutrients, and enter the differentiation phase from this point under starvation conditions [<xref rid="B2-biomolecules-03-00943" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. T0, T1, and T7 indicates 0, 1, and 7 h, respectively, after a temperature shift from 11.5 °C to 22.0 °C for cell synchrony. The absence of G1 phase in the *Dictyostelium* cell cycle is not so strange, because there is little or no G1 phase in rapidly dividing cells such as animal cells at the cleavage stage, and also in the true slime mold *Physalum* and *Hydra*. (Basically from Maeda [<xref rid="B3-biomolecules-03-00943" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]).</p>
