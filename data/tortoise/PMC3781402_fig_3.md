abstract: 'We show that light trapped in an optical cavity can be extracted from that cavity in an ultrashort burst by means of a trigger pulse. We find a simple analytic description of this process and show that while the extracted pulse inherits its pulse length from that of the trigger pulse, its wavelength can be completely different. Cavity Optical Pulse Extraction is thus well suited for the development of ultrashort laser sources in new wavelength ranges. We discuss similarities between this process and the generation of Hawking radiation at the optical analogue of an event horizon with extremely high Hawking temperature. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by thorough numerical simulations.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>The COPE scheme's dispersion relation (“light-cone” in relativistic physics) in (a) the laboratory reference frame and in (b) the reference frame co-moving with the TP.</title> The frequency *ω*′ is only conserved in the co-moving frame in which the TP is stationary. All co-propagating modes (solid lines) are (nearly) degenerate with the cavity mode (red mark in the center) marked by the green band. These can be excited by momentum transfer due to scattering at the spatial frequencies of the TP (blue, dash-dotted line) marked by the blue band.</p>
