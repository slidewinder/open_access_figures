abstract: 'Postmortem neuropathology studies report reduced number and size of Purkinje cells (PC) in a majority of cerebellar specimens from persons diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We used diffusion weighted MRI tractography to investigate whether structural changes associated with reduced number and size of PC, could be detected in vivo by measuring streamlines connecting the posterior-lateral region of the cerebellar cortex to the dentate nucleus using an independent component analysis with a ball and stick model. Seed regions were identified in the cerebellar cortex, and streamlines were identified to two sorting regions, the dorsal dentate nucleus (DDN) and the ventral dentate nucleus (VDN), and probability of connection and measures of directional coherence for these streamlines were calculated. Tractography was performed in 14 typically developing children (TD) and 15 children with diagnoses of ASD. Decreased numbers of streamlines were found in the children with ASD in the pathway connecting cerebellar cortex to the right VDN (p-value = 0.015). Reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) values were observed in pathways connecting the cerebellar cortex to the right DDN (p-value = 0.008), the right VDN (p-value = 0.010) and left VDN (p-value = 0.020) in children with ASD compared to the TD group. In an analysis of single subjects, reduced FA in the pathway connecting cerebellar cortex to the right VDN was found in 73% of the children in the ASD group using a threshold of 3 standard errors of the TD group. The detection of diffusion changes in cerebellum may provide an in vivo biomarker of Purkinje cell pathology in children with ASD.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**(A)** Directions of stick compartments obtained by the ICA+BSM in two boys, (left) TD and (right) ASD. Each colored bar represents primary orientation of individual axonal bundle within the voxel of cerebellar white matter. **(B)** Voxels having no stick compartments were denoted by red boxes. **(C)** The density of cerebellar voxels having no stick compartments was evaluated in individual children in both the TD and ASD groups. To avoid a confound of size of the cerebellum, the total number of voxels having no stick compartments was normalized by total number of voxels in entire cerebellum which yields the density of voxels having no stick compartments. The TD group shows a significant age-related decrease in the density of voxels having no stick compartments (*R*<sup>2</sup> = 0.48, *p* = 0.0044), while the ASD group shows no age related decrease (*R*<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, *p* = 0.619).</p>
