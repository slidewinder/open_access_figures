abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 11
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Electron microscopy of the corpus callosum illustrates axon and myelin changes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). **(A–C)** Sagittal sections of the corpus callosum from sham **(A)** and 1 week after TBI **(B, C**; 1.5-mm impact**)**. A normal distribution of myelinated fibers is shown in the sham mouse **(A)**. After TBI, axon degeneration **(**white arrows; **B, C)** is prominent. Degenerating axons exhibit swellings with accumulation of vesicles **(**inset; **C)**. Examples of demyelinated fibers are also apparent in images from the mice with TBI **(**black arrowheads; **B, C)**. The TBI tissues also had notably elongated, redundant myelin figures (white arrowheads) associated with degenerating axons **(B**, arrowhead furthest to right**)** or void of an axon **(B**, arrowhead along bottom**)**. **(D–G)** Quantification of axon and myelin pathology. Axon degeneration was significantly increased at 1 week after injury (1.5 mm) versus sham (p &lt; 0.0001 for total fibers), which was mainly associated with myelinated fibers (p &lt; 0.0001 fibers with myelin, black; p &lt; 0.0058 fibers without myelin, gray) **(D)**. Redundant myelin figures were highly correlated with degenerating axons in mice with TBI **(E)**. Demyelinated axons were significantly increased in mice with TBI **(F)**, but this did not correlate with the frequency of degenerating axons **(G)**. Sample size of cohorts was n = 3 for each condition, sham, and TBI at 1 week after surgery. Scale bars = **(A–C**, shown in **C)** 2 μm; **(**inset in **C)** 2 μm. Values shown are squared millimeter × 10<sup>3</sup>.</p>
