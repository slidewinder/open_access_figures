abstract: 'In Guangxi, a province of southern China, an important number of dogs and cats roam freely in rural settings, and the presence of these animals in proximity of people may represent a risk of parasitic zoonoses. The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence and identify gastrointestinal helminths in feral carnivores in Guangxi province. Therefore, post mortem examination was performed in 40 dogs and in 39 cats.The Gastrointestinal helminths were found in all the necropsied dogs and in 37 out of 39 cats. Fifteen species were identified including 7 trematodes, 3 cestodes and 5 nematodes. Most of them may be responsible for zoonotic infections.Major zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths, including liver and intestinal flukes, Toxocara spp., and Ancylostoma spp., are present in feral dogs and cats in Guangxi, and may represent a significant risk for public health.'

The body surface is covered with spines from the collar to the anterior testis; (**c**) *Pharyngostomum cordatum* from a cat; **d** Buccal capsule of *Ancylostoma ceylanicum* from a cat. The anterior edge of the buccal capsule is armed with a pair of large hook-like teeth; **e** Lateral view of male bursa of *Ancylostoma ceylanicum* from a cat; **f** *Ancylostoma caninum* from a dog. The wide buccal capsule bears three pairs of ventral teeth; **g** Rostellum of *Dipylidium caninum* from a dog. Identification characteristics include a rostellum armed with several alternating rows of thorn-shaped hooks, uterine capsules with several eggs, a vagina posterior to the cirrus-sac; **h** Mature proglottid of *Dipylidium caninum* from a dog; **i** Egg capsules of gravid proglottid of *Dipylidium caninum* from a dog.
