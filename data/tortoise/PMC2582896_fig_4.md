abstract: 'The kinesin-13 motor protein family members drive the removal of tubulin from microtubules (MTs) to promote MT turnover. A point mutation of the kinesin-13 family member mitotic centromere-associated kinesin/Kif2C (E491A) isolates the tubulin-removal conformation of the motor, and appears distinct from all previously described kinesin-13 conformations derived from nucleotide analogues. The E491A mutant removes tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs stoichiometrically in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but is unable to efficiently release from detached tubulin dimers to recycle catalytically. Only in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) can the mutant catalytically remove tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs because the affinity of the mutant for detached tubulin dimers in ADP is low relative to lattice-bound tubulin. Thus, the motor can regenerate for further cycles of disassembly. Using the mutant, we show that release of tubulin by kinesin-13 motors occurs at the transition state for ATP hydrolysis, which illustrates a significant divergence in their coupling to ATP turnover relative to motile kinesins.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**A model of the MCAK depolymerization reaction.** (A) MTs supersaturated with E491A can be rapidly disassembled in ATP. (B) The lower the ratio of E491A to tubulin, the less effective the motor is in disassembling MTs in ATP. (C) E491A is capable of steady catalytic disassembly of MTs in ADP because the motor can release from tubulin and recycle back onto MT lattice. (D) A model for MCAK-dependent disassembly of MTs. Our data suggests that MCAK can completely remove one tubulin dimer before ATP hydrolysis. M:D:Mt represents ADP–MCAK diffusing on MT, M:T:Mt* represents the first ATP–MCAK depolymerization transition state, M:T*:tb represents the ATP hydrolysis transition state/low tubulin affinity transition state, and M:DPi + tb represents ADP-Pi–MCAK dissociated from tubulin dimer. A postulated zero ATP state is also shown. This state exhibits high affinity for the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</xref>). (E) MCAK's affinity for tubulin decreases upon reaching the ATP transition state, unlike motile kinesins. (F) Phylogenetic distances based on an alignment of the Switch I, Switch II, and the P-loop of kinesins, myosins, and G proteins. Alignments are shown in Fig. S4 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805145/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805145/DC1</ext-link>).</p>
