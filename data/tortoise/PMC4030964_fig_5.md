abstract: 'In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are self-reproducing organelles with their own DNA and they play a central role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by respiration. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondria also have critical and multiple functions in the initiation of cell differentiation, cell-type determination, cell movement, and pattern formation. This has been most strikingly realized in development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium. For example, the expression of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4 (mt-rps4) gene is required for the initial differentiation. The Dictyostelium homologue (Dd-TRAP1) of TRAP-1 (tumor necrosis receptor-associated protein 1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone belonging to the Hsp90 family, allows the prompt transition of cells from growth to differentiation through a novel prestarvation factor (PSF-3) in growth medium. Moreover, a cell-type-specific organelle named a prespore-specific vacuole (PSV) is constructed by mitochondrial transformation with the help of the Golgi complex. Mitochondria are also closely involved in a variety of cellular activities including CN-resistant respiration and apoptosis. These mitochondrial functions are reviewed in this article, with special emphasis on the regulation of Dictyostelium development.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>A working hypothesis for explaining the existence of the GDT-point in the *Dictyostelium* cell-cycle, by assuming a temporally oscillating PSR activity during synchronized cell growth. This model is based on the fact that there is a good correlation between the expression patterns of the prestarvation (PS) genes and the GDT point-specific genes, and is also constructed from the presumption that the amount of PSFs (*i.e*., PSF activity) in an ideally synchronized cell population may oscillate in a cell-cycle dependent manner during growth, as shown here. The cell-cycle positions of T0 and T7 offer themselves repeatedly during the course of a completely synchronized growth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-03-00943-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The PSR activity reaches the maximum value at the GDT-point (arrow between T7 and T0) in each cell cycle. Although it is presently unknown whether the expressions of Dd-TRAP1 and/or the amount of PSF-3 actually oscillate in a cell-cycle dependent manner, increasing their basal levels during the progression of synchronous cell growth, this issue remains to be examined in future. The horizontal axis of this figure represents incubation time (h) of an ideally synchronized *D. discoideum* (Ax-2) cell population in growth medium at 22.0 °C. T0 and T7 indicates 0 and 7 h, respectively, after a temperature shift from 11.5 °C to 22.0 °C for cell synchrony, and these are repeatedly represented during a prolonged time of synchronized culture.</p>
