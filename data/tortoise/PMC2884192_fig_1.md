abstract: 'We report that 18 conserved, and by extension functional, elements in the human genome are the result of retroposon insertions that are evolving under purifying selection in mammals. We show evidence that 1 of the 18 elements regulates the expression of ASXL3 during development by encoding an alternatively spliced exon that causes nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript. The retroposon that gave rise to these functional elements was quickly inactivated in the mammalian ancestor, and all traces of it have been lost due to neutral decay. However, the tuatara has maintained a near-ancestral version of this retroposon in its extant genome, which allows us to connect the 18 human elements to the evolutionary events that created them. We propose that conservation efforts over more than 100 years may not have only prevented the tuatara from going extinct but could have preserved our ability to understand the evolutionary history of functional elements in the human genome. Through simulations, we argue that species with historically low population sizes are more likely to harbor ancient mobile elements for long periods of time and in near-ancestral states, making these species indispensable in understanding the evolutionary origin of functional elements in the human genome.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Evolution of the EDGR-LINE in vertebrates. (**A**) Parsimony suggests that the EDGR-LINE was introduced in the common ancestor of tetrapods and lobe-finned fish, and lineages where the LINE was active are shown with green. The LINE is not noticeable in mammals, crocodylia, aves, or testudines, so it has already been inactivated at least twice in evolution. The branch from the amniote ancestor to mammals is where we believe the human exaptations occurred because the exaptations are at least as old as the therian ancestor but show no sign of orthologous instances in nonmammalian amniotes. Subtrees are labeled for lineages that have extant species branching from the lineage to emphasize that the tuatara and coelacanth are thought to be on long branches with no other species. Divergence dates and topology are from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graur and Li 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shedlock and Edwards 2009</xref>). (**B**) The maximum likelihood branch lengths for the EDGR-LINE consensus sequences, when fit to the species tree, show the consensus to be evolving slower in the tuatara and the coelacanth than the green lizard or frog. Branches are scaled to and labeled with the number of substitutions per site.</p>
