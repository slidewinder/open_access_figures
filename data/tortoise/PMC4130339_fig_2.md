abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Cross-sectional ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with postimaging tissue analysis. **(A, B)** Color-encoded fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from ex vivo DTI of brains at 3 days after sham **(A)** or 1.5-mm impact **(B)**. Coronal slices show the level of the anterior commissure (ac) midline crossing, which corresponds with the coronal level of impact to the skull at the bregma. The color reflects the fiber orientation within the white matter tracts (red = medial-lateral; green = superior-inferior; blue = anterior-posterior). The corpus callosum region of interest is outlined in white. Scale bar = 1 mm. **(C–E)** Comparison across 0.5-mm coronal slices for values of FA **(C)** and the underlying components of axial **(D)** and radial **(E)** diffusivity. Data show slices throughout the body of the corpus callosum (2 = caudal; 6 = ac; 7 = rostral) at 3 days after sham surgery or concussive brain injury (CBI). A significant decrease in axial diffusivity was observed in Slices 5 and 6 of mice with TBI versus sham. *, p &lt; 0.05 and **, p &lt; 0.01 for injury (n = 5) versus sham (n = 5) for each slice based on 2-way analysis of variance. **(F–J)** Quantification of axon damage **(F**, β-amyloid precursor protein [βAPP] immunolabeling**)**, microglia/macrophage activation **(G**, CD11b immunolabeling**)**, astrogliosis **(H**, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] immunolabeling**)**, myelination **(I**, MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein immunolabeling**)**, and cellularity **(J**, DAPI nuclear stain**)** in the corpus callosum at coronal levels within Slices 5 and 6 after ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging. Significant increases in axon damage **(F)**, microglia/macrophage activation **(G)**, and astrogliosis **(H)** are evident without changes in myelination **(I)** or cellular density **(J)**. ***, p &lt; 0.0001; *, p &lt; 0.05 in TBI (n = 5) versus sham (n = 5).
