abstract: "We examined a secondary contact zone between two species of desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii and G.\_morafkai. The taxa were isolated from a common ancestor during the formation of the Colorado River (4-8\_mya) and are a classic example of allopatric speciation. However, an anomalous population of G.\_agassizii comes into secondary contact with G.\_morafkai east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of Arizona and provides an opportunity to examine reinforcement of species' boundaries under natural conditions. We sampled 234 tortoises representing G.\_agassizii in California (n\_-\_103), G.\_morafkai in Arizona (n\_-\_78), and 53 individuals of undetermined assignment in the contact zone including and surrounding the Black Mountains. We genotyped individuals for 25 STR loci and determined maternal lineage using mtDNA sequence data. We performed multilocus genetic clustering analyses and used multiple statistical methods to detect levels of hybridization. We tested hypotheses about habitat use between G.\_agassizii and G.\_morafkai in the region where they co-occur using habitat suitability models. Gopherus agassizii and G.\_morafkai maintain independent taxonomic identities likely due to ecological niche partitioning, and the maintenance of the hybrid zone is best described by a geographical selection gradient model."

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Location of sample sites for *G.&nbsp;agassizii* (circles) in California (CA), *G.&nbsp;morafkai* (squares) in Arizona (AZ), and individuals of undetermined lineage (triangle) in the presumed contact zone (Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). The California samples represent two different recovery units (RUs); the Colorado Desert RU (FEN, G, CH, and UWV) and the Eastern Mojave RU (SV, IV and IV14), within the distinct population segment (DPS) for *G.&nbsp;agassizii* as defined by the Desert Tortoise Recovery Plan (USFWS <xref rid="b110" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The boundary of the DPS and the state border between California and Arizona is the Colorado River.</p>
