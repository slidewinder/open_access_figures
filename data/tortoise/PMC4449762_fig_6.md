abstract: "We examined a secondary contact zone between two species of desert tortoise, Gopherus agassizii and G.\_morafkai. The taxa were isolated from a common ancestor during the formation of the Colorado River (4-8\_mya) and are a classic example of allopatric speciation. However, an anomalous population of G.\_agassizii comes into secondary contact with G.\_morafkai east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of Arizona and provides an opportunity to examine reinforcement of species' boundaries under natural conditions. We sampled 234 tortoises representing G.\_agassizii in California (n\_-\_103), G.\_morafkai in Arizona (n\_-\_78), and 53 individuals of undetermined assignment in the contact zone including and surrounding the Black Mountains. We genotyped individuals for 25 STR loci and determined maternal lineage using mtDNA sequence data. We performed multilocus genetic clustering analyses and used multiple statistical methods to detect levels of hybridization. We tested hypotheses about habitat use between G.\_agassizii and G.\_morafkai in the region where they co-occur using habitat suitability models. Gopherus agassizii and G.\_morafkai maintain independent taxonomic identities likely due to ecological niche partitioning, and the maintenance of the hybrid zone is best described by a geographical selection gradient model."

### Figure 6
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Probability distribution map of the potential range of *G.&nbsp;agassizii* and *G.&nbsp;morafkai* where “stippled pattern” represents predicted *G.&nbsp;morafkai* (Gomo) habitat and “boxed pattern” represents predicted *G.&nbsp;agassizii* (Goag) habitat. Gray background is not predicted to be habitat for desert tortoises. Habitat suitability modeling of habitat use and niche separation of species based on the genotype of sampled individuals (*G.&nbsp;agassizii*; *G.&nbsp;morafkai*, or admixed) determined from the STRUCTURE analysis Q-values. Sampling sites include *G.&nbsp;agassizii* (circles) in California, *G.&nbsp;morafkai* (squares) in Arizona, and individuals from the secondary contact zone in Arizona (triangles). Location is an inset map of Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref> and is bisected east/west by the Colorado River.</p>
