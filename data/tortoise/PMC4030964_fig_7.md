abstract: 'In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are self-reproducing organelles with their own DNA and they play a central role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by respiration. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondria also have critical and multiple functions in the initiation of cell differentiation, cell-type determination, cell movement, and pattern formation. This has been most strikingly realized in development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium. For example, the expression of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4 (mt-rps4) gene is required for the initial differentiation. The Dictyostelium homologue (Dd-TRAP1) of TRAP-1 (tumor necrosis receptor-associated protein 1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone belonging to the Hsp90 family, allows the prompt transition of cells from growth to differentiation through a novel prestarvation factor (PSF-3) in growth medium. Moreover, a cell-type-specific organelle named a prespore-specific vacuole (PSV) is constructed by mitochondrial transformation with the help of the Golgi complex. Mitochondria are also closely involved in a variety of cellular activities including CN-resistant respiration and apoptosis. These mitochondrial functions are reviewed in this article, with special emphasis on the regulation of Dictyostelium development.'

### Figure 7
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>A diagrammatic representation showing formation of the prespore-specific vacuole (PSV) from a mitochondrion and Golgi vesicles. Prior to PSV formation, mitochondria in differentiating prespore cells undergo drastic transformation to form a sort of vacuole (M vacuole), and some Dd-TRAP1 molecules translocate into the M vacuole. Subsequently, Golgi vesicles containing DIA2, Dd-GRP94 and other materials required for PSV formation fuse with the M vacuole, thus resulting in formation of the lining membrane (red) and the internal fibrous structure in the M vacuole. The mitochondrion-PSV complex is eventually twisted at the junction (arrow) and detached to form the respective organelles. Interestingly, almost all of the DIA2 molecules are selectively translocated to PSVs (possibly M vacuoles) in differentiating prespore cells, and seem to be required for exocytotic secretion of PSVs to form the outer-most membrane of spore cell wall [<xref rid="B15-biomolecules-03-00943" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. M-V, M vacuole; GRP94, glucose-regulated protein 94 (endoplasmic reticulum Hsp90). (Slightly modified from Maeda [<xref rid="B12-biomolecules-03-00943" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).</p>
