abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 6
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Astrogliosis and cell proliferation within the corpus callosum after traumatic brain injury (TBI). **(A–D)** Immunohistochemistry in coronal brain sections to detect actively dividing cells with Ki67 and evaluate astrogliosis based on the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Ki67 shows proliferating cells within the subventricular zone at all time points **(A–D)** and in the corpus callosum mainly at 1 and 3 days after TBI **(B, C)**. GFAP expression is increased through 1 week after TBI **(B–D)** versus naive conditions **(A)**. Proliferating cells include reactive astrocytes **(C**, inset**)**, but relatively few cells are double labeled (GFAP-positive, Ki67-positive). **(E)** Quantification of GFAP immunolabeling indicates that reactive gliosis is significantly increased in the corpus callosum 1 week after injury (*, p &lt; 0.0001; n = 5). This quantification shows values obtained after imaging for the cohort of mice used in the longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). **(F)** Quantification of Ki67-immunolabeled cells within the corpus callosum shows proliferation is significantly increased at 1 and 3 days after injury and returns to baseline values at 1 week (*, p &lt; 0.05 compared to naive; n = 3 per time point). Scale bar = **(A-D**, shown in **D)** 200 μm. LV = lateral ventricle.</p>
