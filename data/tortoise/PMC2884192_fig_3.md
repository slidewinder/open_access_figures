abstract: 'We report that 18 conserved, and by extension functional, elements in the human genome are the result of retroposon insertions that are evolving under purifying selection in mammals. We show evidence that 1 of the 18 elements regulates the expression of ASXL3 during development by encoding an alternatively spliced exon that causes nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript. The retroposon that gave rise to these functional elements was quickly inactivated in the mammalian ancestor, and all traces of it have been lost due to neutral decay. However, the tuatara has maintained a near-ancestral version of this retroposon in its extant genome, which allows us to connect the 18 human elements to the evolutionary events that created them. We propose that conservation efforts over more than 100 years may not have only prevented the tuatara from going extinct but could have preserved our ability to understand the evolutionary history of functional elements in the human genome. Through simulations, we argue that species with historically low population sizes are more likely to harbor ancient mobile elements for long periods of time and in near-ancestral states, making these species indispensable in understanding the evolutionary origin of functional elements in the human genome.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The exon exapted from the EDGR-LINE causes NMD of some transcripts from the *Asxl3* gene during neural differentiation. We incubated neural precursor cells in the presence or absence of the NMD inhibitor emetine (see Materials and methods). (**A**) We visualized the change in splice form abundance by running equal masses of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products from emetine-treated and control cells on an agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide. (**B**) We used an Agilent Bioanalyzer to quantify the relative amount of RT-PCR products including or excluding the exon exapted from the EDGR-LINE (see Materials and methods). The bar graph shows the ratio of inclusive to exclusive transcripts for 16 independent wells from 2 independent differentiations (error bars depict 95% confidence intervals). In the 8 wells treated with emetine, we see a doubling of the *Asxl3* transcripts that include the exapted exon. When the results from the 8 control experiments are compared with results from emetine treatment using a 1-sided unpaired *t*-test, a *P* value of 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> validates the conclusion that the inclusive splice form is accumulating when NMD is inhibited. A transcript from neural polypyrimidline tract binding protein known to be targeted by NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutz et al. 2007</xref>) also increases in relative abundance in these experiments. These results are consistent with the exaptation adding an additional layer of control to the expression of the Asxl3 protein during brain development.</p>
