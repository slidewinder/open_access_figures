abstract: 'Purpureocillium lilacinum and Beauveria bassiana were isolated from lung sampled at necropsy of a 12 year-old female loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) that had displayed abnormal buoyancy. Histopathologic evaluation revealed pleuritis and pneumonia with non-melanized, septate hyphae and fruiting structures identical to those of P. lilacinum. This case emphasizes the importance of a histological correlate to fungal culture when environmental fungi are isolated and demonstrates the infrequent phenomenon of fruiting or conidial production in tissue.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>A heterophilic granuloma extends into an ectactic faveolar space, while the adjacent faveolar space, also ecstatic, is lined on one margin by a thick serofibrinous and heterophilic exudate. Hematoxylin and eosin. Bar=500&nbsp;Âµm. This image was adjusted for contrast, brightness and color balance by applying the levels and sharpen functions of Adobe Photoshop CS5 to the original image as a whole.</p>
