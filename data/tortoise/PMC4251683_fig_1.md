abstract: "BACKGROUND: From 2007 to 2010, (the southern part of) the Netherlands experienced a large Q fever epidemic, with more than 4,000 reported symptomatic cases. Approximately 1 - 5% of the acute Q fever patients develop chronic Q fever. A high IgG antibody titre against phase I of Coxiella burnetii during follow-up is considered a marker of chronic Q fever. However, there is uncertainty about the significance and cause of persistence of high IgG phase I antibody titres in patients that do not have any additional manifestations of chronic Q fever. We studied whether continued or repeated exposure to the source of infection could explain elevated IgG phase I antibody levels. METHODS: A case-control study was performed to analyze predictors for possible chronic Q fever. Possible chronic Q fever cases (n = 53) are patients with phase I IgG antibody titre ≥1:1,024 at any point in the 9 - 18\_months after acute Q fever diagnosis, with a negative PCR test result for C. burnetii DNA and without other disease manifestations. Controls (n = 110) are acute Q fever patients that did not develop chronic Q fever, and who consistently had phase I IgG antibody titre <1:1,024 during the 9 - 18\_months follow-up. Binary logistic regression was performed to analyze the effect of living close to an infected farm on the high antibody titres. A longitudinal analysis described the serological profiles of cases and controls. RESULTS: Proximity to infected farms and contact with animal placental material were not associated with an increased risk for possible chronic Q fever. Possible chronic Q fever patients have high IgG phase II as well as IgG phase I antibody titres, even after 48\_months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: We were unable to explain the cause of persistent high IgG phase I titres among possible chronic Q fever patients by being continuously exposed to the source of infection."
