### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Figure&nbsp;1.** Shared 3′ end of paired autonomous and non-autonomous elements. Non-LTR elements and their non-autonomous partners (LINE/SINE pairs) can be subdivided into two subgroups based on their shared 3′ end sequence: (**A**) stringent and (**B**) relaxed, reviewed in.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50"><sup>50</sup></xref> Schematics of representative examples of the two subgroups are shown. The “stringent” LINE/SINE pair group (**A**) share the 3′ end sequence (green box). Several different LINE/SINE pairs from reptiles, fish, mammals and plants fall into this category. SINEs in this subgroup derived their 3′ end from the LINE sequence. A stem-loop structure in the 3′end is commonly observed in these LINE/SINE pairs (shown as a loop). The transcripts of the “relaxed” SINE/LINE pair group (**B**) share a 3′-poly(A) tail, which include the human LINE-1 element with its two open reading frames, ORF1 (purple) and ORF2 (orange). LINE-1 provides the proteins that mobilize several non-autonomous RNAs *in trans:* mRNAs generating processed pseudogenes and the composite retrotransposon SVA (SINE-VNTR-Alu) element which are transcribed by the RNA polymerase II (pol II); and the RNA polymerase III (pol III) transcribed SINEs that are ancestrally derived from pol III genes, such as 7SL and tRNAs. Some of these SINE transcripts form secondary structures (represented as looped lines inside the boxes) that are important for retrotransposition. One example is Alu (shown as a dimeric molecule where each non-identical side was individually derived from the 7SL gene, represented as blue boxes separated by an A-rich region represented by “AA”). “U”s at the end of the transcripts represent pol III termination and blue “N”s represent sequences preceding the pol III termination signal derived from the flanking DNA of the specific locus generating the transcript. However, the vast majority of SINEs are derived from tRNA genes (represented as a purple box). The SINEs with polyA tails can be further subdivided into two classes, class T- and class T+, depending on the presence/absence of a polyadenylation signal (pAS) and a TC-motif preceding the pol III terminator and polyA tail at the 3′ end.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
