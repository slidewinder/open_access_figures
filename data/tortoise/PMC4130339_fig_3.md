abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Longitudinal in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum after the 1.5-mm skull impact. A longitudinal cohort (n = 5 mice) was scanned for baseline measurements on the day before traumatic brain injury (TBI) with repeat scans after injury after 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week. **(A–C)** T2-weighted imaging at the coronal level corresponding to the impact site **(A**; ac = midline crossing of the anterior commissure; Slice 6**)** and at more rostral levels within the body of the corpus callosum **(B**, Slice 7**)** and further rostral **(C**, rostral to scanned region**)**. Areas of T2 signal hyperintensity are present in the superficial cortex in **C** (arrows). **(D–F)** Quantitative analysis of fractional anisotropy **(D)** and the underlying components of axial **(E)** and radial **(F)** diffusivity across preinjury and postinjury time points. Data represent values from the corpus callosum in coronal slices (0.5 mm × 2) corresponding to Slices 5 and 6 of the ex vivo analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> for region-of-interest and coronal levels). FA and axial diffusivity values are significantly reduced after injury. *, p &lt; 0.05 using one-way analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons to baseline. Values shown as mean ± SD.
