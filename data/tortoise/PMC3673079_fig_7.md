abstract: 'Colorimetric sensing, which transduces environmental changes into visible color changes, provides a simple yet powerful detection mechanism that is well-suited to the development of low-cost and low-power sensors. A new approach in colorimetric sensing exploits the structural color of photonic crystals (PCs) to create environmentally-influenced color-changeable materials. PCs are composed of periodic dielectrics or metallo-dielectric nanostructures that affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves (EM) by defining the allowed and forbidden photonic bands. Simultaneously, an amazing variety of naturally occurring biological systems exhibit iridescent color due to the presence of PC structures throughout multi-dimensional space. In particular, some kinds of the structural colors in living organisms can be reversibly changed in reaction to external stimuli. Based on the lessons learned from natural photonic structures, some specific examples of PCs-based colorimetric sensors are presented in detail to demonstrate their unprecedented potential in practical applications, such as the detections of temperature, pH, ionic species, solvents, vapor, humidity, pressure and biomolecules. The combination of the nanofabrication technique, useful design methodologies inspired by biological systems and colorimetric sensing will lead to substantial developments in low-cost, miniaturized and widely deployable optical sensors.'

### Figure 7
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>(**A**) Top view and cross-sectional view of the SEM images of as-prepared 1D TiO<sub>2</sub> PCs films. The high and low-density regions of the structure are labeled. All the scale bars indicate 200 nm. (**B**) Colorful photographs of the sensor taken under the low and high humidity environments. (**C**) Sensitivity of device. Sensitivity values above the dashed red line indicate that a 1% RH change causes a detectable color change in the PC sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-sensors-13-04192">34</xref>].</p>
