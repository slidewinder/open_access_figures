abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 19
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Quick releases of a high amplitude simulated by the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f14-ijms-09-02658">Figure 14</xref>.  (a) Isometric state, the torques 1 and 2 are equilibrated. (b) During the release the Z-filament twisting stage increased transiently e.g. to &gt;B, when the zero point of the Hookenian elasticity is passed over and the thin filament becomes slack. But the thin filament torque has started rotation (arrow 3), and drills the thin filament into the myosin cross-bridges (arrow 4), as long as shortening is stopped. (c) When shortening is stopped, e.g. at the Z-filament twisting stage &lt;A, Ca<sup>2+</sup> was displaced already in stage &gt;B, resulting in feedback oscillations and reversal or reduction of torque (arrow 1), so that the increasing thin filament torque (arrow 2) can again untwist the Z-filaments and produce force redevelopment. (d) A second release, e.g. in a slack test, can further relax to stage A, where a torque equilibrium may be not more possible (comp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f15-ijms-09-02658">Figure 15</xref> b, c). The strong force-deficit or torque-loss is here shown by the decreased pitch of the model thin filament, that does not so occur in real thin filaments.</p>
