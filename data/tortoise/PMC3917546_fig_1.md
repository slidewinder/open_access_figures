### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>CPB-mediated gross pathology and histological damage of rabbit ileal intestinal loops. Rabbit ligated intestinal loops were inoculated with a type C CN3685 isolate (WT), isogenic single toxin mutants, purified CPB or medium (unioculated TGY medium) and then incubated for 6 h. **A**) Gross pathology. Loops inoculated with the WT, Δ*pfo*A, Δ*cpa*, or purified CPB are severely hemorrhagic and distended with fluid. No significant gross abnormalities are observed in the loops inoculated with two different Δ*cpb* mutants or sterile TGY medium. **B**) Histology. Control loops inoculated with sterile TGY, and loops inoculated with the Δ*cpb* mutant showed normal intestinal villi with a well-preserved epithelium and lamina propria. Loops inoculated with wild type CN3685 (WT) or the complemented Δ*cpb/cpb s*howed histological damage consisting of necrosis and loss of epithelium, necrosis of lamina propria, blunting of the villi, hemorrhage of the mucosa and diffuse neutrophilic infiltration of mucosa and sub mucosa (Reproduced from Sayeed *et al.* 2008, with permission from Wiley Blackwell publisher).</p>
