abstract: 'The reptile fauna of Romania comprises 23 species, out of which 12 species reach here the limit of their geographic range. We compiled and updated a national database of the reptile species occurrences from a variety of sources including our own field surveys, personal communication from specialists, museum collections and the scientific literature. The occurrence records were georeferenced and stored in a geodatabase for additional analysis of their spatial patterns. The spatial analysis revealed a biased sampling effort concentrated in various protected areas, and deficient in the vast agricultural areas of the southern part of Romania. The patterns of species richness showed a higher number of species in the warmer and drier regions, and a relatively low number of species in the rest of the country. Our database provides a starting point for further analyses, and represents a reliable tool for drafting conservation plans. '

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The hotspots of sampling efforts within Romania. The *p* value was &lt; 0.05 when Z scores took values between 1.96 and 61.60, suggesting a highly clustered pattern in the number of reptile occurrences per UTM 5 × 5 km grid cell. The numbered hotspots were: **1** Măcin Mountains **2** Jiului Gorges **3** Iron Gates and Mehedinţi Plateau **4** Sweet chestnut Arboretum of Baia Mare and the surroundings of Baia Mare town **5** Goşman Mountains and the surroundings of Piatra Neamţ town **6** the Danube Delta and Babadag Forest **7** the Danube Delta and Histria Archaeological Complex **8** Canaraua Fetii – Iortmac **9** Hagieni – Cotu Văii Forest **10** Nera river mouth and Baziaş.</p>
