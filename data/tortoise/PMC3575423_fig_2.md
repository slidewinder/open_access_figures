### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Figure&nbsp;2.** SINE genesis model. RNA Pol III products such as tRNAs, U6, 5S rRNA and 7SL undergo nuclear surveillance. Defective or incorrectly formed pol III transcripts are targeted for destruction in the nucleus by the exosome (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). One of the steps in the surveillance of the pol III RNAs occurs through the polyadenylation of the transcript by the TRAMP complex. The diagram shows TRAMP4 composed of Rrf4p, Mtr4p and Air2p in humans. It is proposed that the addition of the polyA tail at the 3â€² end signals the exosome to degrade the RNA. In our model, we propose that a potential outcome is that a few of the defective polyadenylated tRNAs or other pol III RNAs escape degradation by the exosome. This will in turn allow the stochastic interaction with the LINE retrotransposition machinery (in primate lineage expect to find L1 ORF2 protein and L1 ORF1 proteins) already present in the nucleus. LINE proteins may vary in other lineages, such as plants. The retrotransposition of the polyadenylated pol III transcript into the DNA would generate the first ancestral element. Fortuitous integration in a transcriptionally supportive site could lead to the creation of an active element, i.e., the birth of a SINE. In this model, the expansion of the A-tail during insertion caused by the LINE ORF2 protein reverse transcription slippage would significantly favor the introduction of the critical A-tail length to generate a retrotranspositionally competent insert.</p>
