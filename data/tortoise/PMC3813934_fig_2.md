abstract: 'The use of threatened animals as a source of traditional medicines is accelerating the extinction of such species and imposes great challenges to animal conservation. In this study, we propose a feasible strategy for the conservation of threatened medicinal animals that combines trade monitoring and the search for substitutes. First, DNA barcoding provides a powerful technique for monitoring the trade of animal species, which helps in restricting the excessive use and illegal trade of such species. Second, pharmacological tests have been adopted to evaluate the biological equivalence of threatened and domestic animals; based on such testing, potential substitutes are recommended. Based on a review of threatened animal species and their substitutes, we find that the search for substitutes deserves special attention; however, this work is far from complete. These results may be of great value for the conservation of threatened animals and maintaining the heritage of traditional medicine.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Sample information.</title> (A): black rhinoceros; (B): Asian water buffalo; (C): Mongolian gazelle; (D): domestic goat; (E): sheep; (F): red deer; (G): sika deer; (H): Père David's deer; (I): Chinese muntjak; (J): Hawksbill; (K): Chinese softshell turtle; (L): Reeve's turtle. 1: Photograph of animal organs; 2: powdered animal organs, which represent the main market form and which are hard to discriminate; 3: a scanning electron microscope photograph of animal organs (obtained using a JSM-6510 instrument, Japan; gold sputtering treatment: 40 mA, 130 s; SEI: 12 kV; WD: 12 mm; amplification × 5500), no typical diagnostic characteristics are found; 4: sequencing peaks (the peaks were clipped using Codoncode Aligner, and the 24-bp segment can be used to identify all of the animal organ samples).
