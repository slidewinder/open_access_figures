abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 22
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The four Huxley-Simmons phases after quick stretch and release.  (a) Tension transient of an isolated intact frog fibre after a small quick release (from Huxley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b238-ijms-09-02658">238</xref>]). (b) Quick stretch and quick release of a chemically skinned human muscle fibre (from Hilber and Galler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b227-ijms-09-02658">227</xref>]). (c) Quick stretch experiments on a skinned rat leg fibre (from Galler *et al.* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b228-ijms-09-02658">228</xref>]). (d) Quick release experiments on a skinned rat leg fibre (from Galler *et al.* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b229-ijms-09-02658">229</xref>]; with permission, b and c with kind permission of Springer Science and Business Media). Phase l: Elastic extension (during quick stretch) or relaxation (during quick release). Phase 2: Delayed passive thin filament drilling. Stretch: counter clockwise rotation that increases the original torque. Release: clockwise rotation that decreases the original torque. Phase 3: Delayed force increase after stretch by additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding on the Z-filaments during unwinding in the region from stage A to D. Force decrease after release by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-displacement from the Z-filaments wound up in the region from stage D to A. Phase 4: Slow force decrease after stretch, presumably by tropomyosin shift dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-displacement from the thin filaments. Slow force increase after release, presumably by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding on the thin filaments. Note the amplitude-dependent steeper inclination in (c) and (d). Some of the extra Ca<sup>2+</sup> displaced during release in phase 3, may be bound by the thin filaments, prolonging the active state.</p>
