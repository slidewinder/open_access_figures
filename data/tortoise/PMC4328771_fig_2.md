abstract: "Long-term population history can influence the genetic effects of recent bottlenecks. Therefore, for threatened or endangered species, an understanding of the past is relevant when formulating conservation strategies. Levels of variation at neutral markers have been useful for estimating local effective population sizes (N e ) and inferring whether population sizes increased or decreased over time. Furthermore, analyses of genotypic, allelic frequency, and phylogenetic information can potentially be used to separate historical from recent demographic changes. For 15 populations of Galápagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis sp.), we used 12 microsatellite loci and DNA sequences from the mitochondrial control region and a nuclear intron, to reconstruct demographic history on shallow (past ∽100 generations, ∽2500\_years) and deep (pre-Holocene, >10 thousand years ago) timescales. At the deep timescale, three populations showed strong signals of growth, but with different magnitudes and timing, indicating different underlying causes. Furthermore, estimated historical N e of populations across the archipelago showed no correlation with island age or size, underscoring the complexity of predicting demographic history a priori. At the shallow timescale, all populations carried some signature of a genetic bottleneck, and for 12 populations, point estimates of contemporary N e were very small (i.e., < 50). On the basis of the comparison of these genetic estimates with published census size data, N e generally represented ∽0.16 of the census size. However, the variance in this ratio across populations was considerable. Overall, our data suggest that idiosyncratic and geographically localized forces shaped the demographic history of tortoise populations. Furthermore, from a conservation perspective, the separation of demographic events occurring on shallow versus deep timescales permits the identification of naturally rare versus newly rare populations; this distinction should facilitate prioritization of management action."

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>(A) Phylogenetic relationships among Galápagos giant tortoise species used in this study. The tree, including estimated node ages (in millions of years, MYA) and Bayesian posterior probability support values (PP), is simplified from Poulakakis et&nbsp;al. (<xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Tips of the tree are labeled with taxon names, and abbreviations in black circles are the 15 population units used for demographic analyses: PBL, Piedras Blancas; PBR, Puerto Bravo; VD, Volcano Darwin; VA, Volcano Alcedo; CAZ, Cazuela; RU, Roca Unión; CR, Cabo Rosa; ECA, eastern Cerro Azul; WCA, western Cero Azul; AGO, Santiago; PZ, Pinzón; RES, La Reserva; CF, Cerro Fatal; ESP, Española; and SCR, San Cristóbal. (B) Map of Galápagos Archipelago showing major islands, named and labeled with approximate age in million years (see Poulakakis et&nbsp;al. <xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref> and references therein). Locations of the 15 populations are indicated by black circles, with abbreviation as above.</p>
