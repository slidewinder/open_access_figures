abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The thin filaments slide by using the mechanics of a drill-borer.  (a) Surface view of a reconstruction of a thin filament of frog skeletal muscle in EGTA, and (b) of *Limulus* muscle in Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The bright structures wound about the right-handed helical actin filaments are the two tropomyosin coiled-coils, that in (b) are shifted a little to the left. Arrow A<sub>0</sub> indicates the position without Ca<sup>2+</sup>, arrow A<sub>i</sub> the position with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (from Vibert *et al*. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijms-09-02658">35</xref>], with permission). (c) Screw of a right-handed drill-borer, shown in (d) and (e). The inclination angle of the thin filament helix and drill-borer screw is about 70°. (d) The drill-borer works by moving up and down (arrows) the handle with a nut-coil. This causes clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation (arrows) of the screw. (e) When the handle with the nut-coil is fixed, pulling up the screw (arrow up) causes counter-clockwise drilling rotation (arrow cc), as seen from above. (f) High EM magnification of two thin filaments on both sides of a thick filament (“myac” view, Z-band is topwards) of an insect flight muscle in rigor (quick-freeze and deep-etched preparation of John Heuser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijms-09-02658">36</xref>], with permission), When ATP is added to an intact rigor muscle, a stretch can pull out the thin filaments off the cross-bridges (arrows up). That means a counter-clockwise drilling rotation of the thin filaments (arrows cc) as demonstrated by the drill-borer model in (e).</p>
