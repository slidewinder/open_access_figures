abstract: 'Colorimetric sensing, which transduces environmental changes into visible color changes, provides a simple yet powerful detection mechanism that is well-suited to the development of low-cost and low-power sensors. A new approach in colorimetric sensing exploits the structural color of photonic crystals (PCs) to create environmentally-influenced color-changeable materials. PCs are composed of periodic dielectrics or metallo-dielectric nanostructures that affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves (EM) by defining the allowed and forbidden photonic bands. Simultaneously, an amazing variety of naturally occurring biological systems exhibit iridescent color due to the presence of PC structures throughout multi-dimensional space. In particular, some kinds of the structural colors in living organisms can be reversibly changed in reaction to external stimuli. Based on the lessons learned from natural photonic structures, some specific examples of PCs-based colorimetric sensors are presented in detail to demonstrate their unprecedented potential in practical applications, such as the detections of temperature, pH, ionic species, solvents, vapor, humidity, pressure and biomolecules. The combination of the nanofabrication technique, useful design methodologies inspired by biological systems and colorimetric sensing will lead to substantial developments in low-cost, miniaturized and widely deployable optical sensors.'

### Figure 9
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>(**A**) Color change of the photonic gel films quaternized with direct exchange of counteranions. The color of the photonic gel films shifts from transparent to blue, green, and red as hydration energy of the counteranions increases. Reflective spectra and photographs of periodically ordered interconnecting porous gels. (**B**) Schematic representation of the mechanism for color change in the PS-b-QP2VP photonic lamellar gels via direct exchange of counterions. Depending on the hydration characteristics of the counteranions, the selective swelling in the block copolymer lamellar structures can be controlled, causing a change in optical properties. (**C**) Cross-sectional SEM image of a focused ion beam milled dry PS-b-QP2VP lamellar film. (**D**) Changes in the photonic stop band position, the QP2VP lamellar domain thickness, and refractive index of the tunable PS-b-QP2VP photonic gels as a function of the hydration energy of the counteranions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-sensors-13-04192">49</xref>].</p>
