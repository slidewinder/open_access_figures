abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 9
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) transcription is altered in oligodendrocytes of the corpus callosum after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In situ hybridization for PLP mRNA in coronal sections from mice perfused at 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week after TBI (1.5-mm impact) were compared to naive mice. **(A, B)** Coronal sections illustrating PLP transcripts in naive **(A)** and 1 week post-TBI mice **(B)**. Insets show examples of oligodendrocytes with low **(A**, inset**)** and high **(B**, inset**)** levels of PLP mRNA signal. **(C–E)** Quantification in the corpus callosum for the total number of PLP-expressing oligodendrocytes **(C)**. Oligodendrocytes with a low level of PLP transcripts are more abundant in normal adult mice **(D)** than oligodendrocytes with high PLP expression **(E)**. Sample size of cohorts was n = 3 (naive and 1 day after TBI), n = 4 (3 days after TBI), and n = 5 (1 week after TBI). The density of total oligodendrocytes does not differ significantly across time points **(C**; p = 0.0949**)**. The number of oligodendrocytes with low levels of PLP transcript decreased 1 and 3 days after injury **(D**; *, p &lt; 0.05**)**. Oligodendrocytes that expressed high levels of PLP mRNA were increased at 1 week after TBI but not significantly different **(E**; p = 0.1769**)**. **(F)** Analysis of the proportion of PLP low- and high-expressing cells shows a significant shift that takes into account the simultaneous changes in both populations at a given time point **(F**; **, p &lt; 0.001; ***, p &lt; 0.0001**)**. Scale bars = **(A, B**, shown in **B)** 200 μm; **(**inserts in **A** and **B**, shown in insert **B)** 10 μm. CC = corpus callosum, cg = cingulum, LV = lateral ventricle.</p>
