abstract: 'The kinesin-13 motor protein family members drive the removal of tubulin from microtubules (MTs) to promote MT turnover. A point mutation of the kinesin-13 family member mitotic centromere-associated kinesin/Kif2C (E491A) isolates the tubulin-removal conformation of the motor, and appears distinct from all previously described kinesin-13 conformations derived from nucleotide analogues. The E491A mutant removes tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs stoichiometrically in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but is unable to efficiently release from detached tubulin dimers to recycle catalytically. Only in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) can the mutant catalytically remove tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs because the affinity of the mutant for detached tubulin dimers in ADP is low relative to lattice-bound tubulin. Thus, the motor can regenerate for further cycles of disassembly. Using the mutant, we show that release of tubulin by kinesin-13 motors occurs at the transition state for ATP hydrolysis, which illustrates a significant divergence in their coupling to ATP turnover relative to motile kinesins.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Switch II mutants sequester tubulin in vivo.** (A) Cells transfected with E491A or G489A mutant MCAK have near-normal total tubulin content. For E491A and G489A, *n* = 52 cells; for wt, *n* = 38 cells. Error bars indicate SEM of the tubulin ratio. (B) Images of representative cells containing wt EGFP-MCAK, G489A mutant (G), or E491A mutant (E). Although quantification shows near normal tubulin content, immunofluorescence reveals that most of the MT polymer is gone, which suggests that the MTs have been disassembled via tubulin sequestration.
