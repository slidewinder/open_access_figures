abstract: 'Mounting evidence of climatic effects on riverine environments and adaptive responses of fishes have elicited growing conservation concerns. Measures to rectify population declines include assessment of local extinction risk, population ecology, viability, and genetic differentiation. While conservation planning has been largely informed by neutral genetic structure, there has been a dearth of critical information regarding the role of non-neutral or functional genetic variation. We evaluated genetic variation among steelhead trout of the Columbia River Basin, which supports diverse populations distributed among dynamic landscapes. We categorized 188 SNP loci as either putatively neutral or candidates for divergent selection (non-neutral) using a multitest association approach. Neutral variation distinguished lineages and defined broad-scale population structure consistent with previous studies, but fine-scale resolution was also detected at levels not previously observed. Within distinct coastal and inland lineages, we identified nine and 22 candidate loci commonly associated with precipitation or temperature variables and putatively under divergent selection. Observed patterns of non-neutral variation suggest overall climate is likely to shape local adaptation (e.g., potential rapid evolution) of steelhead trout in the Columbia River region. Broad geographic patterns of neutral and non-neutral variation demonstrated here can be used to accommodate priorities for regional management and inform long-term conservation of this species.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Neighbor-joining trees depicting Nei's genetic distances among inland lineage populations. Numbers at branch ends correspond to population reference numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) Trees are based on (A) neutral variation – 146 SNPs, and (B) non-neutral variation – 22 SNPs. Bootstrap support exceeding 50% appears at nodes. Population symbols correspond with DPS: triangles – Snake River, circles – upper Columbia River, squares – middle Columbia River. Major drainage sub-basins are labeled on the left. The symbol (*) represents climate related distinction among Lower Clearwater River populations and (£) represents differences among Yakima River populations based on climate. The symbol (®) identifies the branch adjoining Clearwater River and M. F. Salmon River populations. The color scale indicates population ranking by climate (1 = coldest, 115 = warmest) for 115 inland populations identified by reference number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p>
