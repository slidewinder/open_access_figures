abstract: 'Purpureocillium lilacinum and Beauveria bassiana were isolated from lung sampled at necropsy of a 12 year-old female loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) that had displayed abnormal buoyancy. Histopathologic evaluation revealed pleuritis and pneumonia with non-melanized, septate hyphae and fruiting structures identical to those of P. lilacinum. This case emphasizes the importance of a histological correlate to fungal culture when environmental fungi are isolated and demonstrates the infrequent phenomenon of fruiting or conidial production in tissue.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Fungal fruiting structures composed of dense clusters of phialidic conidiogenous cells supported on metulae with chains of oval to subglobose conidia borne from these conidiogenous cells are present in the faveolar space; filamentous fungal hyphae with septae and parallel walls invade the adjacent faveolar wall.
