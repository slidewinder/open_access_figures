abstract: ' BACKGROUND: During their evolution towards a complete life cycle on land, stem reptiles developed both an impermeable multi-layered keratinized epidermis and skin appendages (scales) providing mechanical, thermal, and chemical protection. Previous studies have demonstrated that, despite the presence of a particularly armored skin, crocodylians have exquisite mechanosensory abilities thanks to the presence of small integumentary sensory organs (ISOs) distributed on postcranial and/or cranial scales. RESULTS: Here, we analyze and compare the structure, innervation, embryonic morphogenesis and sensory functions of postcranial, cranial, and lingual sensory organs of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and the spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus). Our molecular analyses indicate that sensory neurons of crocodylian ISOs express a large repertoire of transduction channels involved in mechano-, thermo-, and chemosensory functions, and our electrophysiological analyses confirm that each ISO exhibits a combined sensitivity to mechanical, thermal and pH stimuli (but not hyper-osmotic salinity), making them remarkable multi-sensorial micro-organs with no equivalent in the sensory systems of other vertebrate lineages. We also show that ISOs all exhibit similar morphologies and modes of development, despite forming at different stages of scale morphogenesis across the body. CONCLUSIONS: The ancestral vertebrate diffused sensory system of the skin was transformed in the crocodylian lineages into an array of discrete multi-sensory micro-organs innervated by multiple pools of sensory neurons. This discretization of skin sensory expression sites is unique among vertebrates and allowed crocodylians to develop a highly-armored, but very sensitive, skin.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Innervation patterns of integumentary sensory organs in crocodylians.** Macro-photographs of the Nile crocodile trunk **(A)** and head **(B)**, and spectacled Caiman head **(C)**. Lower panels show parasagittal sections of the corresponding integumentary sensory organs (ISOs) processed for immunostaining of various neuronal markers: neuron-specific enolase (NSE), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), neuron cytoplasmic protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurofilament, heavy polypeptide (NEFH), neuron-specific nuclear protein (NEUN), somatostatin (SST), or substance P (SP). Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). The epidermal-dermal junction is indicated by dashed lines. Magnification bars, 100 μm. **(D)** Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of genes (names indicated on the left), encoding transduction channels with different sensory modalities (vertical black rectangles), in Nile crocodile and spectacled caiman ISO-bearing skin tissues from different body parts (Ja, jaws; Do, dorsum; Ve, ventrum; Ne, neck; To, tongue). The embryonic brain (Br) of crocodylian species was used as a positive control for gene expression. Blue dashed rectangles indicate differential expression of *Trpa1* and *Trpm8* in Nile crocodile and spectacled caiman. **(E)** Parasagittal cryosections of ISOs stained using whole-mount *in situ* hybridization with probes targeting various ion channel genes (indicated on the corresponding panel) on embryonic Nile crocodile heads at E45 (small insets). The epidermal-dermal junction is indicated by dashed lines. Magnification bars: 100 μm.</p>
