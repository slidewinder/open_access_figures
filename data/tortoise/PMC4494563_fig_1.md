abstract: "There has, in recent years, been a paradigm shift in our understanding of the role of the immune system in the development of cancers. Immune dysregulation, manifesting as chronic inflammation, not only facilitates the growth and spread of tumors but prevents the host from mounting effective immune defenses against it. Many attempts are being made to develop novel immunotherapeutic strategies, but there is growing evidence that a radical reevaluation of the mode of action of chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation is required in the light of advances in immunology. Based on the concept of hormesis - defined as the presence of\_different modes of action of therapeutic modalities at different doses - a 'repositioning' of chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be required in all aspects of cancer management. In the case of chemotherapy, this may involve\_a change from the maximum tolerated dose concept to low dose intermittent ('metronomic') therapy, whilst in radiation therapy, highly accurate stereotactic targeting enables ablative, antigen-releasing (immunogenic) doses of radiation to be delivered to the tumor with sparing of surrounding normal tissues. Coupled with emerging immunotherapeutic procedures, the future of cancer treatment may well lie in repositioned chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and more localized debulking surgery."
