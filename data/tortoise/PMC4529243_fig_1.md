abstract: "Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are rare evolutionary events with profound consequences. They double an organism's genetic content, immediately creating a reproductive barrier between it and its ancestors and providing raw material for the divergence of gene functions between paralogs. Almost all eukaryotic genome sequences bear evidence of ancient WGDs, but the causes of these events and the timing of intermediate steps have been difficult to discern. One of the best-characterized WGDs occurred in the lineage leading to the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Marcet-Houben and Gabaldón now show that, rather than simply doubling the DNA of a single ancestor, the yeast WGD likely involved mating between two different ancestral species followed by a doubling of the genome to restore fertility."

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>A simple model of WGD, gene loss, and synteny relationships.</title> The upper panel shows how duplicated blocks were initially identified using only genes that remain in duplicate in *S*. *cerevisiae* [<xref rid="pbio.1002221.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The lower panel shows how additional data from non-WGD yeasts such as *Lachancea waltii* [<xref rid="pbio.1002221.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] allowed the parts of the genome that were not initially allocated to blocks to be placed into pairs, providing a duplication map that covered the whole *S*. *cerevisiae* genome. Letters A–W represent genes, and dots represent centromeres. Only two chromosomes (yellow and brown) are shown.</p>
