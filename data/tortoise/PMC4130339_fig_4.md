abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>β-Amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) demonstration of impaired axonal transport in the corpus callosum (CC). **(A–D)** Immunohistochemistry on coronal brain sections for βAPP as an indicator of axon damage that is associated with impaired rapid axonal transport. In naive mice **(A)**, βAPP is present in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons but immunoreactivity in the CC reflects only background staining. Mice with 1.5-mm injury **(B–D)** show βAPP immunoreactivity in axonal swellings in the CC that are most prominent over the lateral ventricles (LV). **(E, F)** Quantification of the βAPP immunolabeled axons in the CC. Comparison of naive and concussive brain injury (CBI) mice at 1 week after injury **(E)** (*, p &lt; 0.05; n = 5) from the cohort of mice used for the longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). **(F)** In an analysis of βAPP within cohorts sampled at each of the time points used for MRI (naive/baseline, 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week after CBI; n = 3 mice per time point), a significant increase in βAPP indicates axon damage at each time point (*, p &lt; 0.05 compared to naive). Scale bar = **(A–D**, shown in **C)** 200 μm. Cg = cingulum.</p>
