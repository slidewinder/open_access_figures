abstract: "BACKGROUND: In general, growth and differentiation are mutually exclusive but are cooperatively regulated throughout development. Thus, the process of a cell's switching from growth to differentiation is of great importance not only for the development of organisms but also for malignant transformation, in which this process is reversed. We have previously demonstrated using a Dictyostelium model system that the Dictyostelium mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4 (Dd-mrp4) gene expression is essential for the initiation of cell differentiation: Dd-mrp4-null cells fail to initiate differentiation, while the initial step of cell differentiation and the subsequent morphogenesis are markedly enhanced in mrp4 (OE) cells overexpressing the Dd-mrp4 in the extramitochondrial cytoplasm. This raised a possibility that the ectopically enforced expression of the Dd-mrp4 in human cells might inhibit their growth, particularly of malignant tumor cells, by inducing cell differentiation. METHODS: FOUR KINDS OF HUMAN TUMOR CELL LINES WERE TRANSFECTED BY THREE KIND OF VECTOR CONSTRUCTS (THE EMPTY VECTOR: pcDNA3.1 (Mock); pcDNA3.1-rps4 bearing Dictyostelium cytoplasmic ribosomal protein S4; pcDNA3.1-mrp4 bearing Dictyostelium mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4). As controls, four kinds of human primary cultured cells were similarly transfected by the above vector constructs. After transfection, growth kinetics of cells was analyzed using cell viability assay, and also the TUNEL method was used for evaluation of apoptotic cells. RESULTS: Ectopically expressed Dd-mrp4 suppressed cell proliferation through inducing apoptotic cell death specifically in the human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), epithelial cervical cancer (HeLa), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and colonic carcinoma (Caco-2), but not in primary cultured normal cells, such as human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs); human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human normal hepatocytes (hHeps™), with one exception (human cardiac fibloblasts (HCF)). CONCLUSION: The present finding that the ectopically enforced expression of Dd-mrp4 in human several tumor cell lines specifically suppresses their proliferation suggests strongly that the Dd-mrp4 gene derived from Dictyostelium mitochondria may provide a new promising therapeutic strategy for disrupting cell viability pathways in human cancers."

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Growth kinetics and morphological characteristics of human tumor HepG2 cells trnsnfected with the pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-*****rps4 *****(negative control), or pcDNA3.1-*****mrp4 *****vector construct. (A)** Efficiency of vector transfection into HepG2 cells. At 24 and 48 hrs after transfection of the pcDNA3.1 (Mock) or pcDNA3.1-*gfp* (inserted instead of *rps4*), phase-contract (PC) and fluorescence (GFP) micrographs were taken to evaluate the efficiency of vector transfection. It is manifest that a considerable number of cells are strongly stained with GFP. Bar, 20 μm. **(B)** After the vector transfection, HepG2 cells transfected by the pcDNA3.1 (Mock) or pcDNA3.1-*rps4* (negative control) continue to increase their cell number in growth medium. In the case of HepG2 cells transfected by the pcDNA3.1-*mrp4*, increase in the cell number is significantly suppressed during the first 48 hrs of incubation. However, once the decreased number of cells begins to increase during 48-72 hrs after transfection. The results represent the mean±SD in three independent experiments. **(C)** TUNEL assay. HepG2 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 (Mock), pcDNA3.1- *rps4*, or pcDNA3.1-*mrp4* were incubated for 48 hrs and subjected to a TUNEL assay, as described in Methods. From morphological assessment of apoptosis detected by FITC-staining (FITC) and phase-contrast (PC) images of the same field, it is evident that HepG2 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 (Mock) or pcDNA3.1- *rps4* are not stained with the FIFC-conjugated antibody, but that HepG2 cells ectopically expressing the pcDNA3.1*-mrp4* are strongly stained with the antibody. As shown in the most-right column, when HepG2 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 (Mock) was pretreated with DNase-I, they were stained with the FITC-conjugated antibody because of DNA fragmentation as observed in the process of apoptosis.
