abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 8
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>One tropomyosin α-helix is rolled down on a plain.  The side-chains l to 284 consist of 40 1/2 groups (heptads) with seven positions a, b, c, d, e, f and g. The positions a and d form strong hydrophobic bonds with the positions d and a of the second α-helix. The two α-helices twist around one another to form a coiled-coil. The strongly charged side-chains on the coiled-coil surface are drawn as + and −. Coulombic repulsion between equally charged side-chains arranged in axial direction and, according to the “interaction coefficients”, is indicated by double arrows. The H-bonds of the α-helix of one heptad are numbered l to 7. Particularly the outer H-bonds 2, 3, 5 and 6 are stretched by the Coulombic repulsion of the charged side-chains. Every side-chain discharge should shorten the outer H-bonds cooperatively, inevitably producing torque (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijms-09-02658">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
