abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Microglia/macrophage activation within the corpus callosum. **(A–D)** Immunohistochemistry for CD11b to detect microglia/macrophage cells in coronal sections from noninjured naive mice **(A, B)** and mice at 1 week after 1.5-mm skull impact **(C, D)**. The corpus callosum is indicated by hashed lines in **A** and **C**. **(E–G)** Higher-power images illustrate the range of reactive morphologic changes of CD11b-immunolabeled cells in the corpus callosum. CD11b cells in naive mice have fine elaborate processes **(E)**. CD11b-immunolabeled cells have more condensed processes after 1.5-mm skull impact that is present from 1 day **(F)** through 1 week **(D)** after injury. After a 2.0-mm impact, more severe reactive changes are associated with a rounded morphology and lack of processes among CD11b-immunolabeled cells **(G)**. **(H)** Quantification of CD11b immunoreactivity in the corpus callosum shows a significant increase in microglia/macrophage activation at 1 week after TBI (1.5-mm impact) compared to naive control mice (*, p = 0.0122; n = 5). Quantification shows postimaging tissue analysis from the cohort of mice used for the longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Scale bars = **(A, C**, shown in **A)** 200 μm; **(B, D**, shown in **B)** 75 μm; **(E–G)** 40 μm. LV = lateral ventricle.</p>
