abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Diagram for the function of the two components in active striated muscle. The thin filaments are the “contractile component”. The Z-filaments are the “series elastic component”. Torque produces rotations of the Z-filaments (arrows 1) and thin filaments (arrows 2 and 3). The opposed torque of arrow l and arrow 2 is balanced.  (a) to (b) Unloaded shortening. The distal parts of the thin filament helices rotate (arrows 3) and drill (= slide, arrows 4) into the myosin cross-bridges. No force arises, Z-filaments remain twisted, and the titin fibers shorten.   (a) to (c) Isometric force arises when a heavy load prevents the distal filament drilling (arrows 4). The Z-filaments are elastically stretched and untwisted by the now predominant tensile stress and proximal torque (arrows 2) of the thin filaments.   (c) to (b): A quick release of large amplitude results by thin filament drilling when the heavy load is reduced. The titin fibers shorten.  The Z-filaments are drawn with exaggereted largeness. A scheme of J. Spudich provided for Stryer’s “Biochemistry” (third edition, Figure 36–19) was used as the basis for this diagram.</p>
