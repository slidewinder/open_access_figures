abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Bile salts are the major end-metabolites of cholesterol and are also important in lipid and protein digestion and in influencing the intestinal microflora. We greatly extend prior surveys of bile salt diversity in both reptiles and mammals, including analysis of 8,000 year old human coprolites and coprolites from the extinct Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotherium shastense). RESULTS: While there is significant variation of bile salts across species, bile salt profiles are generally stable within families and often within orders of reptiles and mammals, and do not directly correlate with differences in diet. The variation of bile salts generally accords with current molecular phylogenies of reptiles and mammals, including more recent groupings of squamate reptiles. For mammals, the most unusual finding was that the Paenungulates (elephants, manatees, and the rock hyrax) have a very different bile salt profile from the Rufous sengi and South American aardvark, two other mammals classified with Paenungulates in the cohort Afrotheria in molecular phylogenies. Analyses of the approximately 8,000 year old human coprolites yielded a bile salt profile very similar to that found in modern human feces. Analysis of the Shasta ground sloth coprolites (approximately 12,000 years old) showed the predominant presence of glycine-conjugated bile acids, similar to analyses of bile and feces of living sloths, in addition to a complex mixture of plant sterols and stanols expected from an herbivorous diet. CONCLUSIONS: The bile salt synthetic pathway has become longer and more complex throughout vertebrate evolution, with some bile salt modifications only found within single groups such as marsupials. Analysis of the evolution of bile salt structures in different species provides a potentially rich model system for the evolution of a complex biochemical pathway in vertebrates. Our results also demonstrate the stability of bile salts in coprolites preserved in arid climates, suggesting that bile salt analysis may have utility in selected paleontological research.'

### Figure 7
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Overall bile salt variation across vertebrates**. Variation of bile salts is overlaid on a vertebrate phylogeny, with turtles placed as sister group to birds/crocodiles, frogs and salamanders as sister groups, and placental mammals and marsupials as sister groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Lizards are paraphyletic but are indicated here as a single group for comparison purposes. Unresolved relationships are depicted as polyotomies. The figure shows two "shifts to the right" from 5Î±-C<sub>27 </sub>bile alcohols to C<sub>24 </sub>bile acids as the bile salt synthetic pathway presumably grew in length: (1) from Agnatha to ray-finned fish and (2) from lobe-finned fish to tetrapods. Note that C<sub>27 </sub>bile acids are common in reptiles and amphibians but uncommon in fish. Within amphibians, there is only preliminary data on caecilians based on analysis of two specimens, both of which showed only bile alcohols but with the orientation of the 5-hydroxyl group as yet undetermined pending additional analyses (LR Hagey, unpublished data).</p>
