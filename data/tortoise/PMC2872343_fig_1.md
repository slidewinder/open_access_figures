abstract: 'Disturbances such as fire, land clearing, and road building remove vegetation and can have major influences on public health through effects on air quality, aesthetics, recreational opportunities, natural resource availability, and economics. Plant recovery and succession following disturbance are poorly understood in arid lands relative to more temperate regions. This study quantitatively reviewed vegetation reestablishment following a variety of disturbances in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of southwestern North America. A total of 47 studies met inclusion criteria for the review. The time estimated by 29 individual studies for full reestablishment of total perennial plant cover was 76 years. Although long, this time was shorter than an estimated 215 years (among 31 individual studies) required for the recovery of species composition typical of undisturbed areas, assuming that recovery remains linear following the longest time since disturbance measurement made by the studies.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**(a)** View of part of the ghost town of Rhyolite, Nevada, in the Mojave Desert, showing distinct bands of recovering disturbed plant communities (foreground), relatively undisturbed creosote bush communities (center band of darker vegetation), and a de-vegetated band disturbed by mining in the middle-top of the photograph. **(b)** The 2005 Tramp Fire in the eastern Mojave Desert showing clearly demarcated burned habitat (right) and unburned Joshua tree woodland (left). **(c)** With its light color in the middle-top of the photo, the 2005 Loop Fire west of Las Vegas, Nevada, in the Mojave Desert illustrates the landscape-scale scars created by disturbance in the desert. **(d)** Example of undisturbed desert habitat containing the columnar cactus giant saguaro in the Sonoran Desert uplands of Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Photos by S.R. Abella in 2006 (a), 2007 (c), and 2008 (d), and by E.C. Engel in 2008 (b).</p>
