abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Postsurgical response and histopathology vary with impact depth. **(A–E)** Increasing the depth of impact increased the duration of apnea **(A)**, delayed the righting response **(B)**, produced more severe bleeding **(C)**, increased the severity of skull fractures **(D)** (1.0 mm, n = 14; 1.5 mm, n = 29; 2.0 mm, n = 9; sham, n = 7). **(E)** Behavioral testing indicated that the 1.5-mm depth did not produce a marked cortical injury based on comparison to a positive control for test validity, which was a mild controlled cortical impact (CCI). CCI involved a craniotomy and cortical contusion over the right sensorimotor cortex at the same coronal level. The number of foot faults was increased in the beam walk test only after CCI (*, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001; naive, n = 11; CCI, n = 21; 1.5-mm skull impact, n = 11). **(F–N)** Histopathologic differences based on impact depth are evident in coronal sections with hematoxylin and eosin staining of cytoarchitecture **(F–H)**, Luxol fast blue staining of myelin **(I–K)**, and Prussian blue detection of hemosiderin **(L–N)**. Depths of impact setting are indicated for mice examined at 3 days **(F–M)** or 1 week **(N)** after injury. The extensive tissue destruction associated with the 2-mm-impact depth at the level of impact **(F)** extended caudally **(I)** as well as rostrally **(L)** and included extravasation of blood cells (brown), and hemosiderin laden macrophages (L, blue cells; arrows; inset shows enlargement of area near upper arrow) within the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum (CC), and subventricular zone (SVZ) adjacent to the lateral ventricle (LV). The 1.5-mm depth **(G, J, M)** resulted in less overt tissue destruction with reduced myelin staining in the CC over the LV **(J**, with higher magnification shown in **K)**. The 1.5-mm depth produced areas with hemosiderin in the superficial cortex **(M–N**, blue cells; arrows**)**. The 1.0-mm impact did not produce changes detected by hematoxylin and eosin **(H)** or the other histologic techniques examined (data not shown). Scale bars = **(F–J,** shown in **H)** 1 mm; **(K)** 100 μm; **(L–M)** 0.5 mm; **(L insert)** 100 μm; **(N)** 2 mm. n.d. = not detected.</p>
