abstract: 'The use of non-human animals in biomedical research has given important contributions to the medical progress achieved in our day, but it has also been a cause of heated public, scientific and philosophical discussion for hundreds of years. This review, with a mainly European outlook, addresses the history of animal use in biomedical research, some of its main protagonists and antagonists, and its effect on society from Antiquity to the present day, while providing a historical context with which to understand how we have arrived at the current paradigm regarding the ethical treatment of animals in research.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>This full-page illustration of Pasteur in his animal facility was published in *Harper’s Weekly* in the United States, on 21 June 1884. At this time, there was moderate curiosity on Pasteur’s work in the US, which would intensify after his first successful human trials of a therapeutic vaccine for rabies in 1885. In the article, the reader is reassured that the use of dogs is both humane and justified in the interest of mankind. The use of other species, however, is barely mentioned [<xref rid="B5-animals-03-00238" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Source: *Images from the History of Medicine*, U.S. National Library of Science.</p>
