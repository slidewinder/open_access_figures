abstract: 'RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs (ADARs) can be both specific and non-specific, depending on the substrate. Specific editing of particular adenosines may depend on the overall sequence and structural context. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying these preferences are not fully understood. Here, we show that duplex structures mimicking an editing site in the Gabra3 pre-mRNA unexpectedly fail to support RNA editing at the Gabra3 I/M site, although phylogenetic analysis suggest an evolutionarily conserved duplex structure essential for efficient RNA editing. These unusual results led us to revisit the structural requirement for this editing by mutagenesis analysis. In vivo nuclear injection experiments of mutated editing substrates demonstrate that a non-conserved structure is a determinant for editing. This structure contains bulges either on the same or the strand opposing the edited adenosine. The position of these bulges and the distance to the edited base regulate editing. Moreover, elevated folding temperature can lead to a switch in RNA editing suggesting an RNA structural change. Our results indicate the importance of RNA tertiary structure in determining RNA editing.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Sequence and structural elements in hGabra3 required for editing. Predicted RNA secondary structure of the 46-nt hGabra3 substrate. Mutations engineered into expression constructs (M1−M29) were designed to disrupt base pairing interactions or, in combination, to restore base-pairing while changing the identity of base-pairing partners. The mutations (red) and their resultant effects on the predicted duplex structure are shown beside the large structure for each mutant. The edited adenosine is circled in grey. Editing levels of the various constructs was determined by nuclear injection *of Xenopus* oocytes. Editing levels were quantified by a restriction digestion of the editing site. Data are expressed as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. Mutations in Stems 1 and 2 surrounding the editing site have a strong impact on editing, while mutations in Stem 3 have no effect on editing efficiency.</p>
