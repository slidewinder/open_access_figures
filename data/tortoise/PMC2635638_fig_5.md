abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>All twisting stages of the Z-filaments from A to G are shown in side view (upper panel) and axial view (middle panel). Only stage D is here shown in side view also in order to demonstrate that the swastica look with bent cross-arms results by shifting the helix to the Z-disk (arrow in stage D). “Region of Addition” and “Region of Compensation” indicate where the winding distance W (shown in D) increases or decreases the amount of sliding. The Z-filament patterns “small square”, “basket weave” and “diagonal square” appear in the electron microscope when seen in axial direction. These patterns are drawn in the lowest panel according to Yamaguchi *et al*. ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ijms-09-02658">53</xref>], with permission). For more details see text.
