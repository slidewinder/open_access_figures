abstract: 'Although lymphocyte-like cells secreting somatically-recombining receptors have been identified in the jawless fishes (hagfish and lamprey), the cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, rays and chimaera) are the most phylogenetically distant group relative to mammals in which bona fide immunoglobulins (Igs) have been found. Studies of the antibodies and humoral immune responses of cartilaginous fishes and other cold-blooded vertebrates (bony fishes, amphibians and reptiles) are not only revealing information about the emergence and roles of the different Ig heavy and light chain isotypes, but also the evolution of specialised adaptive features such as isotype switching, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation. It is becoming increasingly apparent that while the adaptive immune response in these vertebrate lineages arose a long time ago, it is most definitely not primitive and has evolved to become complex and sophisticated. This review will summarise what is currently known about the immunoglobulins of cold-blooded vertebrates and highlight the differences, and commonalities, between these and more "conventional" mammalian species.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The immunoglobulins of most species are found in the translocon organisation typified by mammals however those of the cartilaginous fishes are found in the so-called “cluster” configuration with only the constant (C) domains for one isotype 3' of a single variable (V) segment, 1–3 diversity (D) segments and a single joining (J) segment [<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; rearrangement occurs almost exclusively within a cluster and not between adjacent clusters [<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Igs of bony fishes are mixed, with their heavy chain loci being present in the translocon configuration but the light chain loci in the cluster configuration.</p>
