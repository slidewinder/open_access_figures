abstract: 'We show that light trapped in an optical cavity can be extracted from that cavity in an ultrashort burst by means of a trigger pulse. We find a simple analytic description of this process and show that while the extracted pulse inherits its pulse length from that of the trigger pulse, its wavelength can be completely different. Cavity Optical Pulse Extraction is thus well suited for the development of ultrashort laser sources in new wavelength ranges. We discuss similarities between this process and the generation of Hawking radiation at the optical analogue of an event horizon with extremely high Hawking temperature. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by thorough numerical simulations.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Properties of COPE pulses versus the clamping parameter *α* (i.e. TP power *P*<sub>0</sub>) for (a) a grating with κ<sub>0</sub>*L* = 6 (i.e. κ<sub>0</sub> = 0.6 mm<sup>−1</sup> and *L* = 10 mm) and a TP with a length of *τ* = 0.03 (i.e *τ* = 3 ps).</title> (red); power enhancement over the linear pump power and (blue) pulse energy versus push parameter *α*. (b) Near-Gaussian shape of the COPE pulse just before the splitting point. (c) Double-peak shape of the COPE pulse close to the point of maximal pushed pulse energy.</p>
