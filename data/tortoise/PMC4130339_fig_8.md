abstract: 'Traumatic brain injury frequently causes traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in white matter tracts. Experimental TAI in the corpus callosum of adult mice was used to examine the effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelin in conjunction with neuroimaging. The injury targeted the corpus callosum over the subventricular zone, a source of neural stem/progenitor cells. Traumatic axonal injury was produced in the rostral body of the corpus callosum by impact onto the skull at the bregma. During the first week after injury, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging showed that axial diffusivity decreased in the corpus callosum and that corresponding regions exhibited significant axon damage accompanied by hypertrophic microglia and reactive astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation increased in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum. Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum shifted toward upregulation of myelin gene transcription. Plp/CreER(T):R26IAP reporter mice showed normal reporter labeling of myelin sheaths 0 to 2 days after injury but labeling was increased between 2 and 7 days after injury. Electron microscopy revealed axon degeneration, demyelination, and redundant myelin figures. These findings expand the cell types and responses to white matter injuries that inform diffusion tensor imaging evaluation and identify pivotal white matter changes after TAI that may affect axon vulnerability vs. recovery after brain injury.'

### Figure 8
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Oligodendrocyte progenitor population increases within the corpus callosum after traumatic brain injury (TBI). **(A–D)** Immunohistochemistry for oligodendrocyte progenitors, identified by NG2 (red) and BrdU (green) to detect proliferation in coronal brain sections. BrdU was administered on the day before TBI (1.5-mm impact). Mice were perfused on Days 1 **(B)**, 3 **(C)**, and 7 **(D)** after injury. Age-matched naive mice **(A)** were injected with BrdU and perfused in parallel. Green arrows show examples of cells immunolabeled only for BrdU. White arrows show examples of cells double labeled for BrdU and NG2. **(E)** BrdU immunolabeling in the corpus callosum appears higher after injury but does not reach significance (p = 0.0709). **(F)** The proportion of NG2 cells that have detectable BrdU increases at 3 and 7 days after TBI (*, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). **(G)** Double labeling for BrdU (green) in the nucleus and NG2 (red) on the cell body and processes along with DAPI nuclear staining (blue). Example shown is the cell at the arrow in **D**. **(H)** The total NG2 population is significantly increased at 7 days after TBI versus naive values (*, p &lt; 0.05). For each value shown **(E, F, H)**, n = 3 naive mice and n = 5 mice with TBI at each time point. Scale bars = **(A–D,** shown in **A)** 200 μm; **(G)** 15 μm. CC = corpus callosum, cg = cingulum, LV = lateral ventricles.</p>
