abstract: 'Disturbances such as fire, land clearing, and road building remove vegetation and can have major influences on public health through effects on air quality, aesthetics, recreational opportunities, natural resource availability, and economics. Plant recovery and succession following disturbance are poorly understood in arid lands relative to more temperate regions. This study quantitatively reviewed vegetation reestablishment following a variety of disturbances in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of southwestern North America. A total of 47 studies met inclusion criteria for the review. The time estimated by 29 individual studies for full reestablishment of total perennial plant cover was 76 years. Although long, this time was shorter than an estimated 215 years (among 31 individual studies) required for the recovery of species composition typical of undisturbed areas, assuming that recovery remains linear following the longest time since disturbance measurement made by the studies.'

### Figure 4
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Illustration of species composition patterns among studies examining post-disturbance plant recovery in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of the American Southwest. Studies are distinguished by desert and disturbance type (fire or land-clearing disturbances such as old roads). **(a)** Undisturbed vegetation, where species are shown as vectors. Vector lengths and directions indicate correlations with different study groupings. Only species exhibiting an r<sup>2</sup> â‰¥ 0.15 are shown. Species are abbreviated as the first three letters of the genus and species given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ijerph-07-01248">Table 4</xref>, and for four species in (a) and (b) not given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ijerph-07-01248">Table 4</xref>, as ACACON = *Acacia constricta*, ASTNUT = *Astragalus nuttallianus*, EPHTRI = *Ephedra trifurca*, and ERIANG = *Eriodictyon angustifolium*. **(b)** Disturbed vegetation. **(c)** Successional vectors showing the difference between disturbed and undisturbed species composition of each study, where increasing lengths of vectors represent greater differences. **(d)** Successional vectors standardized to unit length, comparing the direction of species compositional change among studies.</p>
