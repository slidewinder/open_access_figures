abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 9
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>The conformational change of tropomyosin.  (a) Molecule model of a tropomyosin α-helix with indicated Coulombic repulsion between negatively charged side-chains (double arrows), that stretch the outer H-bonds. (b) The curvature of the α-helix decreases when the repulsion is diminished by side-chain discharge. (a’) and (b’) The angle between two rods R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> increases, i.e. torque is produced when the H-bonds shorten, that causes rotation (arrows in (c)), and a conformational change of the left-handed coiled-coil superhelix shown in (d). (e) A tropomyosin coiled-coil is situated in each groove of the right-handed actin double helix which twists the actin filament (arrows). (f) One coiled-coil is unwound from the actin helix model. (g) Twisting a steel wire helix in the direction of the arrow increases the helix pitch. The relaxed steel helix is shown in (h). Such a pitch change of tropomyosin is not possible since it is bound in the groove of the solid actin filament. It can show the “tropomyosin shift” only (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-09-02658">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>
