abstract: 'Purpureocillium lilacinum and Beauveria bassiana were isolated from lung sampled at necropsy of a 12 year-old female loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) that had displayed abnormal buoyancy. Histopathologic evaluation revealed pleuritis and pneumonia with non-melanized, septate hyphae and fruiting structures identical to those of P. lilacinum. This case emphasizes the importance of a histological correlate to fungal culture when environmental fungi are isolated and demonstrates the infrequent phenomenon of fruiting or conidial production in tissue.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Gross appearance of pneumonia in a loggerhead sea turtle with purpureocilliosis. There is a granulomatous focus surrounded by firm, yellow fibrous tissue in which are variably sized spaces. This image was adjusted for contrast, brightness and color balance by applying the levels and sharpen functions of Adobe Photoshop CS5 to the original image as a whole. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
