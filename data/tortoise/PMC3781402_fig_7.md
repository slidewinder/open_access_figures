abstract: 'We show that light trapped in an optical cavity can be extracted from that cavity in an ultrashort burst by means of a trigger pulse. We find a simple analytic description of this process and show that while the extracted pulse inherits its pulse length from that of the trigger pulse, its wavelength can be completely different. Cavity Optical Pulse Extraction is thus well suited for the development of ultrashort laser sources in new wavelength ranges. We discuss similarities between this process and the generation of Hawking radiation at the optical analogue of an event horizon with extremely high Hawking temperature. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by thorough numerical simulations.'

### Figure 7
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Field evolution inside the cavity – showing the modulus of the backward propagating cavity field (blue, solid), corresponding to the superposition of the trapped field and the COPE pulse and the modulus of the TP (green, dashed).</title> (a) Weak cavity with *τ* = 12 ps, κ<sub>0</sub> = 0.3 mm<sup>−1</sup>, and *P*<sub>0</sub> = 275 kW (*α* = 0.8); (b) Strong cavity with *τ* = 5 ps, κ<sub>0</sub> = 0.6 mm<sup>−1</sup>, and *P*<sub>0</sub> = 308 kW (*α* = 0.5). A more detailed view of the evolution is given in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Media 1</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Media 2</xref>) respectively.</p>
