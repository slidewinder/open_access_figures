abstract: 'Colorimetric sensing, which transduces environmental changes into visible color changes, provides a simple yet powerful detection mechanism that is well-suited to the development of low-cost and low-power sensors. A new approach in colorimetric sensing exploits the structural color of photonic crystals (PCs) to create environmentally-influenced color-changeable materials. PCs are composed of periodic dielectrics or metallo-dielectric nanostructures that affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves (EM) by defining the allowed and forbidden photonic bands. Simultaneously, an amazing variety of naturally occurring biological systems exhibit iridescent color due to the presence of PC structures throughout multi-dimensional space. In particular, some kinds of the structural colors in living organisms can be reversibly changed in reaction to external stimuli. Based on the lessons learned from natural photonic structures, some specific examples of PCs-based colorimetric sensors are presented in detail to demonstrate their unprecedented potential in practical applications, such as the detections of temperature, pH, ionic species, solvents, vapor, humidity, pressure and biomolecules. The combination of the nanofabrication technique, useful design methodologies inspired by biological systems and colorimetric sensing will lead to substantial developments in low-cost, miniaturized and widely deployable optical sensors.'

<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Naturally occurring composite multiscale photonic structures with variable structural colors. (**A**) The male *Chlorophila obscuripennis* beetle; its elytra displays an inconspicuous iridescent bluish green color. (**B**) Optical microscopic image of an elytron under 1,000Ã— magnification. It is composed of a framework composed of green hexagonal veins and a cyan center. (**C**) SEM images of top view (left) and transverse cross-section (right) of the outer elytral surface. The elytral surface comprises of an array of hexagonal pits. (**D**) TEM transverse cross section of the ridge (top) and basin regions (bottom) of the outermost elytra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-sensors-13-04192">19</xref>].</p>
