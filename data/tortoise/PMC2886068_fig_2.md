abstract: ' BACKGROUND: Bile salts are the major end-metabolites of cholesterol and are also important in lipid and protein digestion and in influencing the intestinal microflora. We greatly extend prior surveys of bile salt diversity in both reptiles and mammals, including analysis of 8,000 year old human coprolites and coprolites from the extinct Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotherium shastense). RESULTS: While there is significant variation of bile salts across species, bile salt profiles are generally stable within families and often within orders of reptiles and mammals, and do not directly correlate with differences in diet. The variation of bile salts generally accords with current molecular phylogenies of reptiles and mammals, including more recent groupings of squamate reptiles. For mammals, the most unusual finding was that the Paenungulates (elephants, manatees, and the rock hyrax) have a very different bile salt profile from the Rufous sengi and South American aardvark, two other mammals classified with Paenungulates in the cohort Afrotheria in molecular phylogenies. Analyses of the approximately 8,000 year old human coprolites yielded a bile salt profile very similar to that found in modern human feces. Analysis of the Shasta ground sloth coprolites (approximately 12,000 years old) showed the predominant presence of glycine-conjugated bile acids, similar to analyses of bile and feces of living sloths, in addition to a complex mixture of plant sterols and stanols expected from an herbivorous diet. CONCLUSIONS: The bile salt synthetic pathway has become longer and more complex throughout vertebrate evolution, with some bile salt modifications only found within single groups such as marsupials. Analysis of the evolution of bile salt structures in different species provides a potentially rich model system for the evolution of a complex biochemical pathway in vertebrates. Our results also demonstrate the stability of bile salts in coprolites preserved in arid climates, suggesting that bile salt analysis may have utility in selected paleontological research.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Bile salt synthetic pathways**. The enzymatic pathways involved in bile salt synthesis have so far been elucidated only in humans and rodents. The pathway shown is the 'neutral' pathway, as opposed to the 'acidic' pathway that modifies the side-chain before the steroid nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The ultimate production of the default C<sub>24 </sub>bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) requires multiple changes to the original cholesterol structure including 7α-hydroxylation, isomerization of the C-5 - C-6 double bond (from cholesterol) to form a Δ<sup>4 </sup>compound coupled with oxidation of the 3β-hydroxy group to a 3-oxo group, stereospecific reduction of the 3-oxo group to a 3α-hydroxy group, hydroxylation of the terminal carbon atom of the side-chain, oxidation of the side-chain (to form a C<sub>27 </sub>bile acid), and shortening of the side-chain. Animals using C<sub>27 </sub>bile alcohols or C<sub>27 </sub>bile acids as their primary bile salts presumably require fewer enzymatic steps than those synthesizing C<sub>24 </sub>bile acids. The enzymes involved in 5α-reduction leading to 5α-bile salts are currently unknown. The stem C<sub>27 </sub>5β-bile alcohol would be 3α,7α,27-trihydroxy-5β-cholestan, while the stem C<sub>27 </sub>5β-bile acid would be 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestan-27-oic acid. Note that some steps in the pathway require more than one enzyme (e.g., isomerization of the 3β-hydroxy group of cholesterol to the 3α configuration), whereas some enzymes (e.g., CYP27A1) can catalyze more than one reaction. Double bonds or additional hydroxyl groups may be added to the nucleus or side-chain, either on an intermediate or on the completed stem bile alcohol or acid.</p>
