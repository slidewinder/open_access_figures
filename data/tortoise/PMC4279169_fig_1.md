abstract: 'Although lymphocyte-like cells secreting somatically-recombining receptors have been identified in the jawless fishes (hagfish and lamprey), the cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, rays and chimaera) are the most phylogenetically distant group relative to mammals in which bona fide immunoglobulins (Igs) have been found. Studies of the antibodies and humoral immune responses of cartilaginous fishes and other cold-blooded vertebrates (bony fishes, amphibians and reptiles) are not only revealing information about the emergence and roles of the different Ig heavy and light chain isotypes, but also the evolution of specialised adaptive features such as isotype switching, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation. It is becoming increasingly apparent that while the adaptive immune response in these vertebrate lineages arose a long time ago, it is most definitely not primitive and has evolved to become complex and sophisticated. This review will summarise what is currently known about the immunoglobulins of cold-blooded vertebrates and highlight the differences, and commonalities, between these and more "conventional" mammalian species.'

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>This schematic illustrates the phylogeny of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain isotypes as well as other AIS features as they are currently understood in vertebrates. Except for boxes with broken outlines columns indicate common ancestry; white boxes indicate the isotype has not been found in that particular vertebrate lineage. Although somatic hypermutation (SHM) [<xref rid="B14-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] is present in the jawless fishes, they do not possess Igs, instead they relying upon VLRs for their adaptive response [<xref rid="B2-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. IgM, IgD, κ and λ isotypes are found in almost every vertebrate lineage. The heavy chain isotype IgY is found from amphibians onwards and is believed to have given rise to both IgG and IgE in mammals [<xref rid="B15-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while amphibian IgX is both orthologous and functionally analogous to IgA of birds and mammals [<xref rid="B16-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus far the light chain isotype σ has only been found in cartilaginous fishes, bony fishes and amphibians; σ-2 has recently been identified in representatives of the bony fishes [<xref rid="B17-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in addition to the cartilaginous fishes after which it was originally named (“σ-cart”) [<xref rid="B18-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Conventional class switching (CSR) is first found in amphibians, however recent data from cartilaginous fishes indicates that rearranged V regions from one cluster can be expressed with the constant regions from a different cluster, suggesting an unconventional form of SHM-mediated switch in this lineage [<xref rid="B19-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Shark Ig loci lack switch (S) regions and, curiously, switching does not appear to be the unidirectional process that it is in mammals, thus how (or if) this process is directed remains to be clarified. Although primordial germinal centre-like cell aggregates have been observed in bony fishes [<xref rid="B20-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] “classical” germinal centres (GCs) are only found in warm blooded vertebrates (birds and mammals).</p>
