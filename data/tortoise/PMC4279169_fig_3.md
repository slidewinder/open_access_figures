abstract: 'Although lymphocyte-like cells secreting somatically-recombining receptors have been identified in the jawless fishes (hagfish and lamprey), the cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, rays and chimaera) are the most phylogenetically distant group relative to mammals in which bona fide immunoglobulins (Igs) have been found. Studies of the antibodies and humoral immune responses of cartilaginous fishes and other cold-blooded vertebrates (bony fishes, amphibians and reptiles) are not only revealing information about the emergence and roles of the different Ig heavy and light chain isotypes, but also the evolution of specialised adaptive features such as isotype switching, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation. It is becoming increasingly apparent that while the adaptive immune response in these vertebrate lineages arose a long time ago, it is most definitely not primitive and has evolved to become complex and sophisticated. This review will summarise what is currently known about the immunoglobulins of cold-blooded vertebrates and highlight the differences, and commonalities, between these and more "conventional" mammalian species.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Schematic representation of genomic organisation of the IgH locus in (**A**) Bony fishes: Zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) has a single τ, μ, and δ gene, where the gene encoding IgT is embedded within that of IgM [<xref rid="B63-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]; (**B**) Amphibian: The frog (*Xenopus tropicalis*) IgH locus has one gene each for μ, δ, χ, ν, and φ [<xref rid="B77-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]; (**C**) Reptiles: Squamata: The green anole (*Anolis carinolensis*) has only one gene for μ, δ, and ν [<xref rid="B78-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]; Testudines: painted turtles (*Chrysemys picta belli*) have multiple copies of δ2 that are transcribed in the opposite direction to those of μ, δ, ν [<xref rid="B79-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]; Crocodilians: American alligator (*Alligator mississippiensis*) has multiple copies of the μ, α and ν genes and has α- and IgD2-encoding genes that are transcribed in the opposite direction to the other genes [<xref rid="B80-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]; (**D**) Birds: Chickens (*Gallus gallus*) have one copy each of μ, α and ν. As in reptiles the chicken α gene is transcribed in opposite direction to the others [<xref rid="B81-biomolecules-04-01045" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]; (**E**) Mammals: Humans (*Homo sapiens*) have multiple copies of γ and α; all human IgH genes are transcribed in the same orientation. Arrows indicate the direction of gene transcription and all pseudogenes have been excluded for clarity. Genes and intergenic distances are not drawn to scale.</p>
