abstract: 'We report that 18 conserved, and by extension functional, elements in the human genome are the result of retroposon insertions that are evolving under purifying selection in mammals. We show evidence that 1 of the 18 elements regulates the expression of ASXL3 during development by encoding an alternatively spliced exon that causes nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript. The retroposon that gave rise to these functional elements was quickly inactivated in the mammalian ancestor, and all traces of it have been lost due to neutral decay. However, the tuatara has maintained a near-ancestral version of this retroposon in its extant genome, which allows us to connect the 18 human elements to the evolutionary events that created them. We propose that conservation efforts over more than 100 years may not have only prevented the tuatara from going extinct but could have preserved our ability to understand the evolutionary history of functional elements in the human genome. Through simulations, we argue that species with historically low population sizes are more likely to harbor ancient mobile elements for long periods of time and in near-ancestral states, making these species indispensable in understanding the evolutionary origin of functional elements in the human genome.'

### Figure 5
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Effect of population size on repeat propagation and silencing. (**A**) We use 3 different values of the coefficient of selection for a mobile element insertion that represent a realistic range for a LINE insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houle and Nuzhdin 2004</xref>). From the coefficient of selection and an estimate of an active LINE having a probability of 0.01 to retrotranspose each generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ostertag et al. 2002</xref>), we calculated the expected number of repeat insertions that will happen each generation and eventually become fixed in the population. As the population size increases, less repeat insertions will be expected to fix in the genome. The inset plot shows the same data, but on a log scale and up to a population size of 10 000. (**B**) Mutations that silence repeat instances will be slightly beneficial to the host. We calculate that more of these repeat silencing mutations that will eventually fix in the population are expected as the population size increases. Together (**A** and **B**) demonstrate that species with low effective population sizes are expected to accumulate more repeat insertions and less mechanisms to silence or remove them. (**C**) We simulated a genome evolving with a mobile element family for 4 different population sizes and plotted the average number of active copies (copies that can make new instances of the mobile element) present in a haploid genome. Source copies are present in the genomes of small populations for longer periods of time and in higher quantities. The inset figure shows the same data on a log scale and up to 2 000 000 generations. (**D**) In our simulation, a repeat family dies when it no longer has any active copies in any member of the population, meaning that it will not be able to make additional insertions. This graph shows the probability density of generations until complete silencing of the repeat family for 4 population sizes. As populations become smaller, the time until silencing becomes longer and more stochastic.</p>
