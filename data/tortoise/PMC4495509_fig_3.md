abstract: 'The use of non-human animals in biomedical research has given important contributions to the medical progress achieved in our day, but it has also been a cause of heated public, scientific and philosophical discussion for hundreds of years. This review, with a mainly European outlook, addresses the history of animal use in biomedical research, some of its main protagonists and antagonists, and its effect on society from Antiquity to the present day, while providing a historical context with which to understand how we have arrived at the current paradigm regarding the ethical treatment of animals in research.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>“A physiological demonstration with vivisection of a dog,” by Émile-Édouard Mouchy. This 1832 oil painting—the only secular painting known of the artist—illustrates how French scholars valued physiological experimentation in service of scientific progress [<xref rid="B90-animals-03-00238" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Notice how the struggling of the animal does not seem to affect the physiologist or his observers. Currently part of the *Wellcome Gallery* collection, London. Source: *Wellcome Library*.</p>
