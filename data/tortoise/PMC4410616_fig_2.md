abstract: 'The insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) plays a key role in the development and maintenance of cancer. Since the first links between growth factor receptors and oncogenes were noted over three decades ago, targeting the IGF-1R has been of great interest. This review follows the progress from inception through intense pharmaceutical development, disappointing clinical trials and recent updates to the signaling paradigm. In light of major developments in signaling understanding and activation complexities, we examine reasons for failure of first line targeting approaches. Recent findings include the fact that the IGF-1R can signal in the absence of the ligand, in the absence of kinase activity, and utilizes components of the GPCR system. With recognition of the unappreciated complexities that this first wave of targeting approaches encountered, we advocate re-recognition of IGF-1R as a valid target for cancer treatment and look to future directions, where both research and pharmaceutical strengths can lend themselves to finally unearthing anti-IGF-1R potential.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Reasons for failure of IGF-1R targeting**. Summary of reasons suggested for the failure of IGF-1R targeting strategies: Constitutive activation of downstream signaling nodules such as Ras and PI3K drive signaling independent of the receptor. First-line targeted therapeutics such as blocking antibodies could be sequestered by plasma IGF-1R and in instances where they do reach the cell membrane, can act as biased agonists instead of antagonists, still activating a subset of signaling pathways. Similarly, IGF-1R:IR act as hybrid receptors, capable of binding natural ligands, activating signaling and likely lie under the radar of blocking IGF-1R antibodies. Altogether, a lack of biomarkers and insufficient understanding about the IGF-1R signaling complexities is likely to be the cause of clinical trial failure.</p>
