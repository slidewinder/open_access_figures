abstract: "Gerontology focuses on deterioration with increasing age, but in most populations most variables, including survival probability, improve at early ages (ontogenescence) before deteriorating at advanced ages (senescence). The extent to which gerontology needs to consider this U-shaped pattern of risk over age depends upon the mechanistic, demographic and evolutionary links and interactions between ontogenescence and senescence. In reading the literature on both senescence and ontogenescence, and in interacting with other biogerontologists, we have encountered a set of what we view as inaccurate or oversimplified claims about ontogenescence, its relationship to senescence and its importance to gerontology. Here, after briefly introducing ontogenescence, we address four of these claims. We demonstrate the counterfactual nature of Claim 1. Ontogenescence is an environmental effect largely absent in protected environments. We then briefly review the literature which leads to Claim 2. Senescence and ontogenescence are parts of the same phenomenon, and describe why we reject this view. We then explain why the rejection of Claim 2 does not necessarily support Claim 3, the idea that senescence and ontogenescence are easily separable. Finally, we examine Claim 4. Gerontologists don't need to think about ontogenescence, and give some examples of why we consider this misguided."

### Figure 1
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**Age-specific survival for four populations, illustrating the separability of ontogenescence from senescence**. **(A)** Humans (United Kingdom period data for 2009 shown) experience classical U-shaped mortality, with both ontogenescence and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Human Mortality Database, 2011</xref>). **(B)** Bdelloid rotifers (*Macrotrachela quadricornifera*) in the Ricci lab avoid ontogenescence, but not senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Ricci et al., 2007</xref> and personal communication, Ricci, 2011). Data from 24 individuals are shown, but this pattern is seen repeatedly across trials and bdelloid species. **(C)** Hydra of strain AEP developing in and hatching from eggs suffer intense ontogenescence (159/344 pre-adults died, meaning 46% mortality between egg formation and reproductive maturity), but do not senesce. **(D)** Hydra of the same strain, under the same conditions, but developing as buds rather than eggs, experience no age-related mortality (0/122 pre-adults died) as juveniles or adults.</p>
