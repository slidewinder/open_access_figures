abstract: 'Frailty is a state of late life decline and vulnerability, typified by physical weakness and decreased physiologic reserve. The epidemiology and pathophysiology of frailty share features with those of cardiovascular disease. Gait speed can be used as a measure of frailty and is a powerful predictor of mortality. Advancing age is a potent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has been associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Older adults comprise approximately half of cardiac surgery patients, and account for nearly 80% of the major complications and deaths following surgery. The ability of traditional risk models to predict mortality and major morbidity in older patients being considered for cardiac surgery may improve if frailty, as measured by gait speed, is included in their assessment. It is possible that in the future frailty assessment may assist in choosing among therapies (e.g., surgical vs. percutaneous aortic valve replacement for patients with aortic stenosis).'

<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Predicted probability of mortality or major morbidity according to Gait Speed and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score.</title> Slow gait speed (solid circles) conferred a 2- to 3-fold increase risk for any given level of STS predicted mortality or major morbidity compared with normal gait speed (open circles). The adjusted odds ratio for mortality or major morbidity was 3.05 (95%CI: 1.23â€“7.54). Reproduced with permission, Elsevier.<xref rid="b96" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref></p>
