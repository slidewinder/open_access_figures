abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 18
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>A quick release of small amplitude is simulated by the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f14-ijms-09-02658">Figure 14</xref>.  (a) Isometric state, the torques of arrow l and arrow 2 are in equilibrium. (b) A quick release of 3 nm has quickly changed the Z-filament twisting stage, e.g. from D to &lt;C (the twisting stage of the model is here somewhat too large), Ca<sup>2+</sup> is displaced (arrows) and a damped feedback oscillation can occur. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> displacement results in a decrease and reversal of the Z-filament torque. Arrow l and arrow 2 work now into the same direction, so that the Z-filaments can again untwist, and the force redevelops. (c) The isometric state with equilibrated torques (arrow l and arrow 2) is again reached. Little torque of the thin filaments is lost. The difference between stage D and &gt;D is not visible.</p>
