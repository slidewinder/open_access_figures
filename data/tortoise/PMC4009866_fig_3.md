abstract: "Assisted colonization-the deliberate translocation of species from unsuitable to suitable regions-is a controversial management tool that aims to prevent the extinction of populations that are unable to migrate in response to climate change or to survive in situ. The identification of suitable translocation sites is therefore a pressing issue. Correlative species distribution models, which are based on occurrence data, are of limited use for site selection for species with historically restricted distributions. In contrast, mechanistic species distribution models hold considerable promise in selecting translocation sites. Here we integrate ecoenergetic and hydrological models to assess the longer-term suitability of the current habitat of one of the world's rarest chelonians, the Critically Endangered Western Swamp Tortoise (Psuedemydura umbrina). Our coupled model allows us to understand the interaction between thermal and hydric constraints on the foraging window of tortoises, based on hydrological projections of its current habitat. The process can then be repeated across a range of future climates to identify regions that would fall within the tortoise's thermodynamic niche. The predictions indicate that climate change will result in reduced hydroperiods for the tortoises. However, under some climate change scenarios, habitat suitability may remain stable or even improve due to increases in the heat budget. We discuss how our predictions can be integrated with energy budget models that can capture the consequences of these biophysical constraints on growth, reproduction and body condition."

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Examples of three simulations of tortoise body temperatures and activity potential at Ellen Brook Nature Reserve using AWAP climate data for 2006 when low winter rainfall severely restricted the swamp hydroperiod (grey shading). Blue lines depict the body temperature (°C) of a tortoise, pink indicates that the tortoise in is water, green indicates selected shade (10 = 100%) and the red panel shows the depth (cm) of the microclimate selected by the tortoise during the aestivation period. The behavioral routines in NicheMapR cause a tortoise to select a microhabitat that maintains its body temperature below its voluntary thermal maximum of 28 °C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="biology-02-00001-t002">Table 2</xref>). At high environmental temperatures the tortoise aestivates and thermoregulates by seeking cooler microhabitats in burrows in up to 80% shade. At lower environmental temperatures the tortoise aestivates just below the surface and ceases to thermoregulate. The tortoise then selects an aquatic environment once the wetland water depth is at least 5cm. (**a**) depicts a scenario where the simulated tortoise was prevented from basking, (**b**) demonstrates a more natural scenario where the tortoise was able to raise its body temperature above its voluntary minimum through ambient basking, while (**c**) presents a hypothetical scenario where basking is maximized (*i.e.*, simulated tortoises preferentially bask rather than swim/forage).</p>
