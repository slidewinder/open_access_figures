abstract: 'The kinesin-13 motor protein family members drive the removal of tubulin from microtubules (MTs) to promote MT turnover. A point mutation of the kinesin-13 family member mitotic centromere-associated kinesin/Kif2C (E491A) isolates the tubulin-removal conformation of the motor, and appears distinct from all previously described kinesin-13 conformations derived from nucleotide analogues. The E491A mutant removes tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs stoichiometrically in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but is unable to efficiently release from detached tubulin dimers to recycle catalytically. Only in adenosine diphosphate (ADP) can the mutant catalytically remove tubulin dimers from stabilized MTs because the affinity of the mutant for detached tubulin dimers in ADP is low relative to lattice-bound tubulin. Thus, the motor can regenerate for further cycles of disassembly. Using the mutant, we show that release of tubulin by kinesin-13 motors occurs at the transition state for ATP hydrolysis, which illustrates a significant divergence in their coupling to ATP turnover relative to motile kinesins.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**In vitro depolymerization in various nucleotide states and MCAK–tubulin stoichiometries.** (A) MT depolymerization reactions performed for 10 min at 23°C with 0.5 mM of the indicated nucleotide and 2.5 μM GMPCPP-tubulin MTs, stopped by centrifugation. Enzyme concentration: 80 nM wt MCAK in ATP (1:31 MCAK/tubulin) and 510 nM in all other reactions (1:5). Tubulin release was measured by a pelleting assay using the stoichiometries of active motor to total tubulin indicated. Values are normalized to control (no motor) tubulin release of 0.13 nM per second (SD 0.02 nM). In contrast to wt MCAK, E491A releases more tubulin in ADP and ADP-Al-F than in ATP. (B) Time course of depolymerization as in A, except 1.7 μM GMPCPP tubulin, 21 nM wt MCAK in ATP (1:81 motor/tubulin), and 510 nM in all other reactions (1:3 motor/tubulin). E491A (at 510 nM) releases 1,200 nM tubulin dimers in 30 min in ADP, which suggests that the motor is recycling. In contrast, in ATP, less than equimolar tubulin is released in 30 min by E491A. (C) Linear depolymerization rates of MT ends directly observed in TIRF microscope. MTs tethered to a coverslip observed in a reaction chamber containing 1.25 μM of GMPCPP-Cy5-tubulin MTs, 2 mM of the indicated nucleotide, and 400–1,600 nM EGFP-E491A-MCAK. The rates are normalized to the nonmotor control tubulin loss rates that were observed to be 0.08 nM per second (SD, 0.03). E491A is capable of disassembling MTs at a high rate in ATP but only when the proportion of motor exceeds that of tubulin. At ∼1:3 motor/tubulin, E491A depolymerizes MTs at a higher rate in ADP than in ATP. (D) Loss of MT polymer observed by light scattering at very low stoichiometry (1:117 motor/tubulin or 1.4:1 MCAK/protofilament ends). Turbidity of reaction mixes with 0.2 mM of the indicated nucleotide, 14 nM MCAK, and 1.64 μM GMPCPP tubulin as 2.5-μm mean length MTs (10.6 nM protofilament ends) at 23°C and monitored at 340 nm. The rate of tubulin loss in the absence of motor and free tubulin is 0.10 nM per second (SD, 0.02), which is consistent with the control rates of tubulin loss for the pelleting and TIRF assays. At &lt;1:100 motor per tubulin stoichiometry, E491A is incapable of disassembling MTs in ATP, whereas in ADP, ∼18 moles of tubulin were released per mole of E491A, indicating that the motor is recycling during successive rounds of tubulin removal. pf, protofilament. Error bars indicate SD of the measured quantity (tubulin released or the linear depolymerization rate).</p>
