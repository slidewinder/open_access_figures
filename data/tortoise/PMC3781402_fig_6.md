abstract: 'We show that light trapped in an optical cavity can be extracted from that cavity in an ultrashort burst by means of a trigger pulse. We find a simple analytic description of this process and show that while the extracted pulse inherits its pulse length from that of the trigger pulse, its wavelength can be completely different. Cavity Optical Pulse Extraction is thus well suited for the development of ultrashort laser sources in new wavelength ranges. We discuss similarities between this process and the generation of Hawking radiation at the optical analogue of an event horizon with extremely high Hawking temperature. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by thorough numerical simulations.'

### Figure 6
<p style='font-size: 10px;'><title>Temporal shape and splitting behavior of COPE pulses versus pump power for cavities with length *L* = 10 mm and a TP FWHM of *τ* = 12 ps, for a (a) weak (κ<sub>0</sub> = 0.3 mm<sup>−1</sup>) and a (b) strong (κ<sub>0</sub> = 0.6 mm<sup>−1</sup>) grating.</title> White curves denote the peak position following from Eq. (12). Inequality (6) is not fulfilled for case (b). The output pulse for each trigger pulse power is adjusted to unit peak value, to fill the color scale. The splitting point denotes the clamping power (*α* = 1).</p>
