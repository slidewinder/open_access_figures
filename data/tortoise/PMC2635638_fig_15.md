abstract: 'This paper provides a comprehensive explanation of striated muscle mechanics and contraction on the basis of filament rotations. Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and alpha-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical "two-component model" of active muscle differentiated a "contractile component" which stretches the "series elastic component" during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation). Since each thin filament is anchored by four elastic alpha-actinin Z-filaments (provided with force-regulating sites for Ca(2+) binding), the thin filament rotations change the torsional twist of the four Z-filaments as the "series elastic components". Large scale models simulate the changes of structure and force in the Z-band by the different Z-filament twisting stages A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Stage D corresponds to the isometric state. The basic phenomena of muscle physiology, i. e. latency relaxation, Fenn-effect, the force-velocity relation, the length-tension relation, unexplained energy, shortening heat, the Huxley-Simmons phases, etc. are explained and interpreted with the help of the model experiments.'

### Figure 15
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>“Quick release” and “slack test” experiments.  (a) Quick releases on tension recorded in maximal isometric tetanus of frog’s sartorius muscle. The quick release amplitudes are shown in mm (from Gasser and Hill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b216-ijms-09-02658">216</xref>]). The approximative twisting stages of the Z-filaments are indicated, and the position of oscillations is denoted. (b) Nine slack test experiments on a skinned rabbit fibre (fibre length 2000 μm, sarcomere length 2.5 μm). From Galler and Hilber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b217-ijms-09-02658">217</xref>]; with kind permission of Springer Science and Business Media. (c) Seven slack test experiments on a single skinned fibre preparation from rat leg muscle (from Galler *et al.* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b218-ijms-09-02658">218</xref>]; with permission). The upper panels show fibre length, Δl is the release amplitude. The lower panels show the force. Arrows indicate end of unloaded shortening, Δt is the time to the redevelopment of force. Approximative twisting stages of the Z-filaments are indicated.</p>
