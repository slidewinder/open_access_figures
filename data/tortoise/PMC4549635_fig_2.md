abstract: 'Some 20 years ago Todd and colleagues proposed that rhythm perception is mediated by the conjunction of a sensory representation of the auditory input and a motor representation of the body (Todd, 1994a, 1995), and that a sense of motion from sound is mediated by the vestibular system (Todd, 1992a, 1993b). These ideas were developed into a sensory-motor theory of rhythm and beat induction (Todd et al., 1999). A neurological substrate was proposed which might form the biological basis of the theory (Todd et al., 2002). The theory was implemented as a computational model and a number of experiments conducted to test it. In the following time there have been several key developments. One is the demonstration that the vestibular system is primal to rhythm perception, and in related work several experiments have provided further evidence that rhythm perception is body dependent. Another is independent advances in imaging, which have revealed the brain areas associated with both vestibular processing and rhythm perception. A third is the finding that vestibular receptors contribute to auditory evoked potentials (Todd et al., 2014a,b). These behavioral and neurobiological developments demand a theoretical overview which could provide a new synthesis over the domain of rhythm perception. In this paper we suggest four propositions as the basis for such a synthesis. (1) Rhythm perception is a form of vestibular perception; (2) Rhythm perception evokes both external and internal guidance of somatotopic representations; (3) A link from the limbic system to the internal guidance pathway mediates the "dance habit"; (4) The vestibular reward mechanism is innate. The new synthesis provides an explanation for a number of phenomena not often considered by rhythm researchers. We discuss these along with possible computational implementations and alternative models and propose a number of new directions for future research.'

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>**(A)** A reproduction of Figure 16 from Todd (<xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">1994a</xref>) illustrating the scheme for computing a modulation spectrum in both pitch and rhythm frequency ranges and in parallel both low-pass and band-pass representations. The abbreviation FDWEDS stands for “frequency domain windowed energy density spectrum” (i.e., the output of a band-pass filter bank). The abbreviation TDWEDS stands for “time domain windowed energy density spectrum” (i.e., the output of low pass filter bank). **(B)** A reproduction of Figure 17 from Todd (<xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) illustrating low-pass vs. band-pass responses which compute approximately the grouping and metrical structure of an anapest rhythm. **(B)** shows an output of the scheme represented in **(A)**.</p>
