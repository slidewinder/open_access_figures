abstract: "The giant tortoises of the Galápagos have become greatly depleted since European discovery of the islands in the 16th Century, with populations declining from an estimated 250 000 to between 8000 and 14 000 in the 1970s. Successful tortoise conservation efforts have focused on species recovery, but ecosystem conservation and restoration requires a better understanding of the wider ecological consequences of this drastic reduction in the archipelago's only large native herbivore. We report the first evidence from palaeoecological records of coprophilous fungal spores of the formerly more extensive geographical range of giant tortoises in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island. Upland tortoise populations on Santa Cruz declined 500-700 years ago, likely the result of human impact or possible climatic change. Former freshwater wetlands, a now limited habitat-type, were found to have converted to Sphagnum bogs concomitant with tortoise loss, subsequently leading to the decline of several now-rare or extinct plant species."

### Figure 2
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Variation in concentration (per cm<sup>3</sup> of sediment) of spores of coprophilous fungi over time at Pernettya, Psidium and East Bog. The timing of expansion of *Sphagnum* at each site, as well as possible drivers behind tortoise loss, is also illustrated. The first known human presence in the Galápagos archipelago occurs at AD 1535. The El Niño frequency curve for the Galápagos is modified from Conroy *et. al*. (2008) and is based on proxy records of % sand occurrence in lake sediments from El Junco lake, San Cristóbal Island; post-AD 1850 data have been excluded as a result of likely anthropogenic impact on the record (Conroy *et&nbsp;al*. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
