abstract: 'In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are self-reproducing organelles with their own DNA and they play a central role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by respiration. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondria also have critical and multiple functions in the initiation of cell differentiation, cell-type determination, cell movement, and pattern formation. This has been most strikingly realized in development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium. For example, the expression of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S4 (mt-rps4) gene is required for the initial differentiation. The Dictyostelium homologue (Dd-TRAP1) of TRAP-1 (tumor necrosis receptor-associated protein 1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone belonging to the Hsp90 family, allows the prompt transition of cells from growth to differentiation through a novel prestarvation factor (PSF-3) in growth medium. Moreover, a cell-type-specific organelle named a prespore-specific vacuole (PSV) is constructed by mitochondrial transformation with the help of the Golgi complex. Mitochondria are also closely involved in a variety of cellular activities including CN-resistant respiration and apoptosis. These mitochondrial functions are reviewed in this article, with special emphasis on the regulation of Dictyostelium development.'

### Figure 3
<p style='font-size: 10px;'>Strategy for creating *rps4*-null cells and their phenotypes. (**a**) As a starting material, LpCSfo cells in which pCoxIV (MTS)-*Sfo*I is expressed under the tetracycline-minus (−Tet) condition, were prepared. Subsequently, the mutant *rps4* gene (Mut-mtDNA for homologous recombination), in which the upstream *Sfo*I-site and a 5'-half of *rps4* coding region were deleted, was introduced into LpCSfo cells to obtain heteroplasmic transformants (LpCSfo<sup>HR</sup> cells) with mitochondria consisting of the Mut-mtDNA and wild-type mtDNA (Wt-mtDNA). Coupled with removal of Tet from growth medium, the fusion protein MTS-*Sfo*I synthesized in the cytoplasm is exclusively transferred into mitochondria of LpCSfo<sup>HR</sup> cells and selectively digests Wt-mtDNA but not Mut-mtDNA. Since the digested Wt-mtDNA is not duplicated, the Mut-mtDNA becomes dominant during the course of growth under the −Tet condition, thus eventually giving *rps4*-null cells. (**b**) These cells were grown in growth medium with (+Tet) or without (−Tet) teteracyclin. Membrane potential of mitochondria was visualized by staining of cells with MitoTracker Orange. As was expected, the staining of mitochondria was almost completely vanished in LpCSfo cells grown without Tet, because their mtDNA with an intact *Sfo*I site would be cleaved by *Sfo*I eventually to become a ρ<sup>0</sup> state devoid of mitochondrial DNA. Bars, 200 nm. (**c**) Development of starved MB35 cells and LpCSfo<sup>HR</sup> cells on agar. MB35 cells and LpCSfo<sup>HR</sup> cells grown with (+Tet) or without (−Tet) tetracycline were washed twice in BSS and plated on 1.5% non-nutrient agar at a density of 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. This was followed by incubation for the indicated time at 22 °C. Bars, 0.5 mm. (Basically from Chida *et al*. [<xref rid="B22-biomolecules-03-00943" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]).</p>
