## open access figures auto-converted to slides

a proof of concept for reusing the scientific literature at scale.

The `getfigures` CLI tool takes a query which it runs against EuropePMC. It takes the results and generates a slidewinder slide with rich metadata for each figure in each paper.

Some example slides are included in the `data` directory.
